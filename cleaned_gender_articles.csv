https://allafrica.com/stories/202503100096.html,"Africa Sees Gender Equality Progress, but Continent 'Still Only Halfway There'","As the world marks International Women's Day, RFI looks at the situation in Africa. Women on the continent are closer to equality today than they were four years ago, according to the latest report by the UN and the African Development Bank, but the continent is still only halfway to achieving gender parity.

Commenting on the report's findings, Nathalie Gahunga, manager of the Gender and Women Empowerment Division at the African Development Bank (AfDB) said they are ""a call to action for African governments to invest in Africa's women and girls for sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development that works for all, across the continent"".

She emphasised that this could be achieved through evidence-based, gender-responsive policies and programmes, adding: ""At the African Development Bank, we will continue collaborating with governments to address this important gap.""

'A more prosperous Africa for all'

The Africa Gender Index 2023 Analytical Report measures gender equality in 54 African countries, scoring them between 0 and 100 - representing full equality.

Entitled ""African Women in Times of Crisis"", this second edition of the Africa Gender Index (AGI) is the latest conducted by the AfDB and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and was released in November 2024.

It shows that between 2019 and 2023, Africa's overall gender index score improved from 48.6 to 50.3 percent. While this marks progress, it also highlights a sobering reality: women on the continent still experience half the economic, social and representation opportunities available to men.

Keiso Matashane-Marite, head of UNECA's Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Section, said: ""None of the targets for United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality are on track. For instance, equal representation in parliaments won't be reached until 2063. This is unacceptable.""

She believes Africa cannot achieve sustainable prosperity if half its potential - that represented by the women of the continent - remains underused.

Matashane-Marite is urging policymakers to act decisively, using the AGI findings to implement practical solutions and close gender gaps.

""The need for accelerated action is clear,"" she said. ""By addressing these gaps, we can build a more inclusive and prosperous Africa for all.""

The AfDB's Gahunga echoed this, saying: ""This effort requires strong support in investing gender data and statistics for more evidence-based decision-making, that leads to transformative public policy reforms.""

Key findings

The report found that women in Africa score just 50.3 percent in equality across economic, social and public representation areas - a slight improvement from the 48 percent score in 2019.

Women in Africa are closer to equality in social areas, with a score of 98.3 - a parameter that includes access to education and healthcare. Girls on the continent now outnumber boys in graduation rates across primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education.

The report also found a 1.5 percent increase in women's representation, which rose to 24.4 percent. However, women continue to be underrepresented in Africa's parliaments, ministerial positions and private leadership roles.

Economically, there has been a decline in gender equality. Women's economic parity dropped from 61 percent in 2019 to 58.2 in 2023. While both men and women experienced economic setbacks during the reported period, women were disproportionately adversely affected.

Women in war zones

Women are also often the first victims of the conflicts raging on the continent.

""When conflict and crisis strike, displacement, hunger, and poverty follow,"" according to the charity Oxfam. ""But, all too often, it is women's rights that become the early casualties of war.""

The charity reports that one in five refugee or displaced women suffers sexual violence, and that in countries affected by conflict girls are 2.5 times more likely not to be in school.

""As they flee conflict, travel, and settle in refugee camps they are highly vulnerable to all forms of violence. They face exploitation, sexual harassment, and rape; they risk being sold into early or unwanted marriages or resorting to survival sex just to get their basic needs for food, shelter, and transport met.""

Recommendations

Building on its findings, the AGI recommends targeted actions to close the gender gap across three key areas.

In the social sphere, the report urges countries to invest in overcoming barriers that prevent women from thriving in education, such as the burden of unpaid domestic work, early marriage and inadequate sanitary facilities in schools.

On representation, the report recommends strict enforcement of gender quotas in order to increase the number of women in leadership roles, in both government and the private sector.

Recognising that women often attain higher education levels than men, the report also calls for African countries to tackle harmful gender norms and practices, and address occupational segregation, to boost women's economic participation.",world marks international womens day rfi looks situation africa women continent closer equality today four years ago according latest report un african development bank continent still halfway achieving gender parity commenting reports findings nathalie gahunga manager gender women empowerment division african development bank afdb said call action african governments invest africas women girls sustainable inclusive socioeconomic development works all across continent emphasised could achieved through evidencebased genderresponsive policies programmes adding african development bank continue collaborating governments address important gap prosperous africa all africa gender index analytical report measures gender equality african countries scoring between representing full equality entitled african women times crisis second edition africa gender index agi latest conducted afdb united nations economic commission africa uneca released november shows between africas overall gender index score improved percent while marks progress also highlights sobering reality women continent still experience half economic social representation opportunities available men keiso matashanemarite head unecas gender equality womens empowerment section said none targets united nations sustainable development goal gender equality track instance equal representation parliaments wont reached until unacceptable believes africa cannot achieve sustainable prosperity half potential represented women continent remains underused dr congo names judith suminwa tuluka first woman pm matashanemarite urging policymakers act decisively using agi findings implement practical solutions close gender gaps need accelerated action clear said addressing gaps build inclusive prosperous africa all afdbs gahunga echoed saying effort requires strong support investing gender data statistics evidencebased decisionmaking leads transformative public policy reforms key findings report found women africa score percent equality across economic social public representation areas slight improvement percent score women africa closer equality social areas score parameter includes access education healthcare girls continent outnumber boys graduation rates across primary lower secondary upper secondary education report also found percent increase womens representation which rose percent however women continue underrepresented africas parliaments ministerial positions private leadership roles economically there has decline gender equality womens economic parity dropped percent while both men women experienced economic setbacks during reported period women disproportionately adversely affected african feminism pumps heart benins debut venice biennale women war zones women also often first victims conflicts raging continent when conflict crisis strike displacement hunger poverty follow according charity oxfam all too often womens rights become early casualties war charity reports one five refugee displaced women suffers sexual violence countries affected conflict girls times likely school flee conflict travel settle refugee camps highly vulnerable all forms violence face exploitation sexual harassment rape risk sold early unwanted marriages resorting survival sex get basic needs food shelter transport met close sign free allafrica newsletters get latest african news delivered straight inbox top headlines africa governance international organisations submitting above agree privacy policy success almost finished need confirm email address complete process please follow instructions email sent error error there problem processing submission please try again later burkina fasos army massacred civilians village raid ngo recommendations building findings agi recommends targeted actions close gender gap across three key areas social sphere report urges countries invest overcoming barriers prevent women thriving education burden unpaid domestic work early marriage inadequate sanitary facilities schools representation report recommends strict enforcement gender quotas order increase number women leadership roles both government private sector recognising women often attain higher education levels men report also calls african countries tackle harmful gender norms practices address occupational segregation boost womens economic participation
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/womens-economic-empowerment/the-gender-pay-gap-report,The Gender Pay Gap Report,"Gender pay gap is a glaring symbol of the ongoing struggle for gender equality. It persists across industries, borders, and generations and no country in the world has been able to successfully close it. The UN Women (2023) report ‘Why Women Earn Less?’ finds that women earn 21% less than men in the East and Southern Africa region, with substantial variations across countries. In fact, the gap exists even after accounting for the average differences in women and men’s education, seniority and work experience, and type of job. This leads to lifetime income inequality between women and men, and further contributes to women’s poverty.

A myriad of reasons explains why women earn less than men. Women have historically been clustered into lower-paying fields, such as caregiving, education, and service industries, while men have dominated higher-paying sectors like technology and finance. Women also have less opportunities for access to leadership positions and opportunities for career advancement. Discrimination, both overt and subtle, plays a critical role in the gender pay gap in the region. Deeply ingrained cultural norms and gender stereotypes underpin the pay gap. These norms can shape educational choices, career aspirations, and workplace behaviour, often reinforcing gender-based wage disparities.

Closing the gap empowers women, stimulates economic growth, and drives social progress. Importantly, achieving pay equity is not just a matter of economic fairness but a reflection of our commitment to a just and equal society. The findings of this report aim to guide a wide variety of stakeholders in understanding and addressing the pay gap.",gender pay gap glaring symbol ongoing struggle gender equality persists across industries borders generations country world has able successfully close un women report why women earn less finds women earn less men east southern africa region substantial variations across countries fact gap exists even accounting average differences women mens education seniority work experience type job leads lifetime income inequality between women men further contributes womens poverty myriad reasons explains why women earn less men women have historically clustered lowerpaying fields caregiving education service industries while men have dominated higherpaying sectors like technology finance women also have less opportunities access leadership positions opportunities career advancement discrimination both overt subtle plays critical role gender pay gap region deeply ingrained cultural norms gender stereotypes underpin pay gap norms shape educational choices career aspirations workplace behaviour often reinforcing genderbased wage disparities closing gap empowers women stimulates economic growth drives social progress importantly achieving pay equity matter economic fairness reflection commitment equal society findings report aim guide wide variety stakeholders understanding addressing pay gap

UN Women pledges to continue efforts to raise awareness and promote policy change to narrow and close the gender pay gap and ensure women and girls have equal rights as their male counterparts.

Closing the gender pay gap Closing the gender gap requires efforts on several levels in the public and private sphere, these include but are not limited to: Improving the social protection system, extended to workers in the formal and informal economy. Including ensuring that social policy work for women and minimal living wages

Policies to transform labour markets

Addressing occupational segregation

Guaranteeing domestic worker’s rights

Increasing the returns to women’s informal employment in rural areas

Ensuring social transfers

Accessible and affordable social services

Provision of quality public childcare and elderly care services, family-friendly workplace policies

Policy measures that address women and girls' disproportionate share of unpaid care responsibilities

Freedom of associations and the right to organize and bargain collectively Closing the gender gap requires efforts on several levels in the public and private sphere, these include but are not limited to:

Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) stipulates ""To achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"". The aim of this goal is to achieve gender equality in the labor market, including equal access to jobs and top decision-making roles; in education, by achieving gender parity in primary education; in access to health; and in all domains to reduce gender-based violence and discrimination to empower women and girls. Goal 8 of the SDGs specifies ""To promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all"". Target 8.5 intends to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value by 2030. While significant progress has been made in realizing goals 5 and 8, we still have a long way to go to fully achieving the goals.

Globally, women only make 77 cents for every dollar men earn, this disparity is one of the main reasons for lifetime income inequality. It is estimated that it will approximately take 70 years to close this gender pay gap.

The gender pay gap demonstrates the relentless inequality between women and men at all levels of our societies. One of the main underlying reasons for the gender pay gap is that jobs tend to be valued along gender lines. Social and cultural norms also play a significant role not only in the types of paid work for women and girls but also in terms of how that work is valued and remunerated. In 1951, the General Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Equal Remuneration Convention, yet to this day, male-dominated and female-dominated industries are still not valued the same. In order to ensure equal pay for work of equal value, we must see a change along the gender lines.

The gender pay gap is at 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 24 percent globally including both the formal and informal sectors. In sub-Saharan Africa, women opt to work in the informal sector mainly to cater to their care responsibilities, and more than 89 percent of women work in the informal economy. Agriculture continues to remain the most important source of income at the grassroots level on the African continent, employing more than 50 percent of women. The majority of agricultural employment is informal.

Women and young women face challenges in balancing paid work and family responsibilities, as they bear the brunt of catering to most of the unpaid care and domestic work responsibilities in households. In sub-Saharan Africa, the gender pay gap is estimated at 31% for women with children compared to only 4% for women without children. Labor policies are thus a critical element in closing the gender pay gap.

Dr. Marjan Petreski, a professor of economics and statistics at the University American College Skopje in North Macedonia, is currently conducting an analysis of the gender pay gap in ten countries within the east and southern Africa region on behalf of UN Women. The analysis is underway but so far has proven that countries in east and southern Africa face varying levels of a raw gender pay gap, the pure difference in hourly wages of men and women, expressed as a percentage of men’s wages. In order to calculate the adjusted gender pay gap, further analysis will be done to take into consideration the personal and job characteristics of women and men in the labor market, to be able to approximate the concept of 'equal pay for jobs of equal value. This will then provide a different picture. In some countries, these characteristics may help in explaining the gender pay gap. For example, in Kenya, labor force participant characteristics explain nearly half of the gender pay gap. While in Namibia and Mauritius, the gender pay gap increases when adjusted, which is not unknown in the literature, revealing that working women in these countries have better personal and job characteristics than working men, hence they cannot explain the gap but rather amplify it.

Speaking about the ongoing study, Prof. Dr. Marjan Petreski said ""A multitude of policies may be relevant for dealing with the gender pay gap, starting from the basic provision for equal pay for work of equal value in the primary labor laws, up to policies related to the minimum wage, flexible working arrangements, a set of anti-discrimination laws and policies and so on.""

Women and girls face numerous challenges in the labor market, including being overrepresented in the informal economy, and too often women are trapped in low-paid and poor-quality work. The disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work further limits their opportunities to fully participate in the workforce. Moreover, they lack social protection and social services, which are crucial in narrowing the gender pay gap. Social protection and social services can enhance women’s income security, their ability to realize their potential, and expand their life options.",momentous day th september international equal pay

https://allafrica.com/stories/202406240339.html,Africa: Meagre Gender Data Blocks Equality for African Women,"analysis

Without information on gender roles and relations, both gender inequality and sustainable development will remain a struggle.

Information on women's status and lived realities is inadequate, especially in Africa. This lack of gender data not only prevents measuring progress on gender equality but achieving sustainable development overall.

Most of Africa won't meet the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 or even in the next 10 or 20 years in some cases. The continent is hamstrung by the legacy of colonisation, internal conflict and external meddling, which has dampened its growth prospects and hindered equitable development.

African countries are also battling to meet gender equality goals. A UN Women report shows that women are still overburdened with unpaid care work, face verbal and physical abuse daily, and earn less money for the same work done. This is the case even after controlling for factors such as education, level of productivity and experience.

Without relevant data, ending gender inequality in Africa will be difficult. And the data required is not just that which categorises information by male and female, but information that captures individuals' lived experiences, better reflecting gender roles, relations and societal inequalities.

Women living in rural areas face unique challenges. They lack access to resources, bear a heavier care work burden and are more likely to be subjected to traditional cultural norms than their urban counterparts. African LGBTQI+ women experience extreme discrimination and prosecution in many African countries. Restrictions on same-sex relationships, lack of freedom of expression and association, and limited protections are common. Data reflecting the particular challenges women face is crucial for developing policies and laws to address these problems.

The lack of gender data is a global problem, spanning geographical regions and income groups, with similar challenges faced across the board. According to the UN Women report, in 2023, over 80 countries were missing information for at least one of the indicators used to track progress towards the gender equality SDG. At current rates, it will take 22 years for all the SDG gender data to be available globally.

Chart 1: Worldwide data gaps, by data typeSource: UN Women

There are diverse reasons for the slow progress. Policies and laws that encourage gender data gathering and integrate gender goals into wider national development plans are lacking.

Financing for gender data collection is also stagnating, with overall spending on generating statistics at a national level falling since COVID-19. A report by Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century found three characteristics of this financing gap: few donors fund gender data; data production is prioritised over other statistical activities; and gender data activities aren't mainstreamed and are often tied to narrow project aims.

Outside countries such as Rwanda, Burkina Faso and Ghana, African statistical offices face similar funding restraints. Also, funding stems from governments and international development partners - a mix that shapes the focus of data generation and hinders the creation of regular gender data. A lack of staff trained to gather this data effectively worsens the problem.

What are the effects of these gaps on Africa? First, governments cannot know whether or not their actions to combat gender inequality are working. Second, women's real needs remain unseen. In some cases, limited gender data is available and collected regularly, but paints only a partial picture of the issue. Third, the lack of gender data precludes governments from making informed decisions that could boost economic growth, climate-resilience and overall health outcomes.

Some steps have been taken in Africa. Significant progress has been made in education and healthcare gender data generation, with statistics on maternal mortality, educational enrolment and life expectancy routinely collected and disaggregated.

UN Women runs a dedicated strategy, Women Count, which promotes gender data production and use through missions in nine countries, six of which are in Africa. UN Women also developed a Minimum Set of Gender Indicators for Africa to help governments know what to monitor and how best to harmonise new gender data within existing frameworks.

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and partners are drafting a continental informal cross-border trade data collection framework and methodology to consolidate data gathering. Cross-border trade is a highly gendered aspect of Africa's trade landscape. A pilot project launched in 2019 by ECA's African Trade Policy Centre and the African Export-Import Bank to better monitor informal cross-border trade between Abidjan and Lagos is an example of a successful initiative.

The first step towards sustained change is simply to implement existing plans. Various documents have been drafted to fill the gender data gap, but concrete action remains absent.

The African Programme on Gender Statistics should serve as a platform for continent-wide action. But an evaluation of its 2018-21 implementation phase showed that one of the partners - the African Union Commission - failed to engage adequately. Regional economic communities also didn't participate. The support of both bodies is vital for creating African gender data infrastructure.

Other essential interventions relate to financing, better alignment of gender data with national priorities, and political commitment. Given that international donors often have narrow, time-sensitive focus areas regarding gender data, African governments must fund data systems that include gender data.

Changing gender norms and instilling gender-equal attitudes among citizens is the most effective and durable solution. Grassroots activism aimed at educating children and the youth on gender equality is crucial, but needs government finance and support.

By investing in comprehensive gender data collection and analysis, African nations can make informed decisions that promote gender equality and benefit society as a whole.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/west-and-central-africa/mali,Mali,"Women in Mali

Mali has one of the fastest-growing populations in the world. Of the 18 million people living in this West African country, about 9 million of them are women. Despite this, the country was ranked 184th out of 189 countries on the 2019 UNDP Human Development Index. Respect for human rights is weak, especially for women and young people, subject to structural inequalities and sociocultural customs that affect their health and severely limit their education, participation in governance, and social and economic independence. The maternal mortality rate is nearly 10 percent and food insecurity particularly affects women and children. Agriculture accounts for the livelihood of most people (mainly women), both in the formal and informal sectors, in the northern and central regions, but unclear land rights have contributed to conflicts between herders and farmers, particularly in the central regions.

According to the Gender Inequality Index in 2020, Mali is ranked 184th in the world. Gender-based violence and female genital mutilation remain widespread across the country and women do not often have access to justice due to social pressures and ignorance of their rights.

Mali’s development is further hindered by the ongoing severe political, social and security crises. On one hand, the Malian political scene has been tumultuous and unstable since 2012 with two military coups since August 2020, most recently in May 2021. Since then, Mali has been ruled by the transition government of Colonel Assimi Goïta. On the other hand, stability is threatened by internal armed conflicts with regular attacks on civilians, resulting in severe humanitarian consequences both within Mali and in the wider region (displacement, food insecurity). Increasingly, the conflict concerns control of illegal trade in narcotics, weapons as well as people. As of 30 September, there have been over 400,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country (UNHCR, 2021). The conflict, further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, reinforces women and girls' existing vulnerabilities, and threatens access to basic social and health services.

UN Women in Mali

Together with UN Country Team, UN -Women supports the Government, civil society, and local communities for a Mali where women, men and youth fully exercise their rights and effectively play their roles for a peaceful, economically inclusive, and reconciled country where men and institutions are respectful and accountable for the human rights of women and support gender equality.

UN Women Mali works on norms, policies, and standards, capacity-building is provided for stakeholders, including the UN, the government, and civil society; on Governance, emphasizing on political institutions and processes, as well as gender planning and budgeting; on Economic Empowerment, with special emphasis on entrepreneurship and climate-smart agriculture; on Violence Against Women, with a priority on the prevention and the timely provision of effective essential services; and finally on Women, Peace & Security, helping to materialize government’s commitments on UNSC/R1325 through a new National Action Plan and the group “the friends of UNSC/R1325”.

UN Women Mali’s country program is being financed by the following partners:

As part of its Beijing+20 Campaign and its work to engage men and boys in gender equality and transforming social and gender norms, UN Women participated in the Men Engagement Capacity Enhancement Training. The workshop was hosted by Advocates for Social Change Kenya (ADSOCK) and a national network of civil society organizations and journalists.

“When the man becomes that transformation, he will automatically model the change we are seeking,” said Faith Nashipae, head of the Male Engagement Thematic area for the State Department of Gender and Affirmative Actions.

The social norms that give men more power and autonomy than women, and the cultural expectations around masculinity also shape men’s decisions and behaviours. Men often feel the pressure to conform to society’s standards of what it means to be a ‘real man.’

Thuku Njuguna, the vice chair of Men for Gender Equality Now, shared, ""Masculinity is both a prejudice to manhood and a book of social laws, or we can even say a guide to which men are held.""

Many men are starting to challenge the pressure associated with traditional masculinity. They are using their voices and privilege to shift norms and perceptions about gender, and are working to address the patriarchal beliefs, practices, institutions, and structures that have contributed to inequality between men and women.

Fredrick Nyagah, the Chairperson of Men Engage Kenya Network, adds, ""Male engagement is an approach to constructively involve men and boys for the benefit of both genders, ultimately achieving gender equality.""

Transforming deeply ingrained gender norms depends on a few critical factors, and UN Women is collaborating with various stakeholders to encourage discussion and promote understanding of the social construction of masculinities within specific contexts.

Men’s participation in helping to shape the future of gender roles and relations is crucial. The training appealed to men to take personal and collective responsibility to help end gender inequality and emphasized accountability and building alliances towards systematic change.

“Women and men should be equal partners. There is no other way to live,” explained Phil Otieno, Executive Director of ADSOCK. He added that the engagement of both parties as a complementary approach has the potential to accelerate the achievement of SDG 5 on Gender Equality and the reduction of harmful gender and cultural norms in Kenya.

UN Women and the participating stakeholders charted a course for action, including engaging male policymakers in discussions about dismantling harmful aspects of traditional masculinity.

In a landmark pronouncement, women drawn from the media and creative industries across Africa made a declaration on media and gender violence that was adopted at the African Women in Media conference (AWiM23) held on 1st December 2023 in Kigali,Rwanda. The Kigali declaration addresses both representation of gender-based violence (GBV) in news media content and in news media organizations.

It acknowledges the media’s power to inform and influence the public’s understanding of GBV and sets out minimum measures for different groups of stakeholders in the media sector. Among the declaration’s key principles are that: media coverage of violence against women and girls should follow gender-ethical principles, the media portrayal and representation of survivors and victims of gender-based violence should be fair, balanced, unbiased and free of gender stereotypes and media organizations, associations and unions should address and combat sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in the physical and online media workplace.

As part of the conference, UN Women East and Southern Regional Office (ESARO) premiered a film that was created as part of a short film festival produced by the office to promote individual advocacy as part of the 2023 16 days of Activism against Gender-based Violence campaign. The 10 short films in the festival were created by an all-women team of film makers from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Rwanda all centered around preventing and ending gender-based violence in line with the 2023 campaign theme, No Excuse for violence against women and girls.

The film that premiered, Jirani by Tanzanian film maker Getrude Sigonda, tells a tale of a woman who notices that her neighbor might be going through gender-based violence and decides to act with her husband to help their neighbor access help.

Speaking at the premiere event, UN Women Rwanda Country Representative, Mme. Jennet Kem said, ""Media wield the power to influence public opinion, mobilize the masses, and transform stereotypes and socio-cultural norms. Engaging the media cannot be taken as an afterthought.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2019/05/the-cost-of-gender-gap-policy-brief,The Cost of the Gender Gap in Agricultural Productivity: Five African Countries,"A growing body of evidence points to a salient feature of the agricultural sector across Sub-Saharan Africa: lower rates of agricultural productivity for female cultivators than for male cultivators. Substantial gender gaps in productivity have arisen not because women are less efficient farmers, but because women experience inequitable access to land and to agricultural inputs. Such unbalanced distribution frequently stems from and is bolstered by deeply entrenched sociocultural norms and traditional expectations of gender roles. This structure of constraints is multifaceted. For example, women are more income- and time-constrained than men, which has repercussions on their ability to access credit, land and appropriate levels of inputs. These constraints thus lead to sizeable gender gaps in the adoption of high-value crops and in the use of agricultural implements, male family labour, pesticides and fertilizer, among other elements. Within this context, the UN Women Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, the United Nations Development Programme–United Nations Environment Programme Poverty-Environment Initiative Africa, and the World Bank commenced a collaboration to create evidence of the links between women’s economic empowerment, sustainable agricultural production and economic growth. The evidence clearly shows that gender gaps in access to inputs have high economic costs and can affect the extent to which farmers adopt new resource management practices and technological innovations.",growing body evidence points salient feature agricultural sector across subsaharan africa lower rates agricultural productivity female cultivators male cultivators substantial gender gaps productivity have arisen because women less efficient farmers because women experience inequitable access land agricultural inputs unbalanced distribution frequently stems bolstered deeply entrenched sociocultural norms traditional expectations gender roles structure constraints multifaceted example women income timeconstrained men which has repercussions ability access credit land appropriate levels inputs constraints thus lead sizeable gender gaps adoption highvalue crops use agricultural implements male family labour pesticides fertilizer among other elements within context un women eastern southern africa regional office united nations development programmeunited nations environment programme povertyenvironment initiative africa world bank commenced collaboration create evidence links between womens economic empowerment sustainable agricultural production economic growth evidence clearly shows gender gaps access inputs have high economic costs affect extent which farmers adopt new resource management practices technological innovations

analysis

Realistic reductions in gender inequality could produce a US$259 billion larger economy in 2043 than current path forecasts.

Rising global fragility fuelled by conflicts, COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war and climate change have worsened gender disparities worldwide.

In Africa, women often face greater vulnerability to climate change due to their social roles, economic circumstances and limited access to resources. They are more likely to rely on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, making their livelihoods susceptible to changing weather patterns, droughts, floods and other climate-related risks. And women are disproportionately represented in the informal economy, which was seriously impacted by COVID-19.

Gender inequalities in Africa are rooted in social and cultural norms and traditions. Despite progress in policy and legislation, the continent is far from achieving gender equality. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst-performing region in the United Nations Development Programme's Gender Inequality Index (see chart) - a composite measure reflecting the disparity between women's and men's achievements in reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market.

At this rate, estimates are that achieving full gender equality in Africa will take over a century. Gender disparities affect education, healthcare, employment, political representation and access to resources.

African women are more likely to die from communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and nutritional deficiencies than men. Although maternal healthcare on the continent has improved in the past two decades, sub-Saharan Africa accounts for around 70% of global maternal deaths, due to gender bias in healthcare access.

Women and girls in Africa also bear the greatest burden of unpaid care and domestic work. They face a higher risk of violence especially at home, and are under-represented in the labour market and politics, governance and decision making. In 2019, women made up 56% of Africa's average labour force, compared to men's 73% - an improvement from a 23 percentage-point gap in 1990.

Regionally, the greatest gap is in North Africa, where the female labour force participation rate was about 22% in 2019 compared to 70% for men. Although North Africa has lower gender inequality in education, this hasn't meant progress for women in the labour market. In 2021, the World Bank reported that women in the region face unfair laws that economically disempower them. Countries such as Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia prohibit women from working in certain industries.

In African parliamentary bodies, women hold on average 24% of seats, while their presence in top executive roles is just 7%. Despite local governments being perceived as entry points for women in politics, women hold only 21% of African council positions. Of the few examples of progress, Rwanda, Namibia, South Africa and Senegal rank among the top 10 nations globally for female parliamentary representation.

Even in education, where Africa has made significant progress in reducing gender inequality, girls in sub-Saharan Africa are still the most disadvantaged compared to other global regions. Widespread child marriage, teenage pregnancy, poverty and the social norm of valuing boys over girls are among the factors that constrain women's access to education.

Climate change compounds these inequities. African women - constrained by societal roles, economic status and restricted resource accessibility - are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change impacts.

Closing these gender inequalities would have major benefits. New research by the Institute for Security Studies' African Futures and Innovation programme shows what Africa's development could gain from more gender inclusion.

Using progress made by other countries or regions at similar levels of development as a benchmark, the study models the impact of an ambitious but realistic reduction in gender inequalities (Gender scenario) on Africa's development prospects to 2043. The report also includes an illustrative Gender Equality scenario that models the effect of full gender equality by 2043, with the full knowledge that this isn't practically achievable.

In the Gender scenario, the 2043 African economy is about US$259 billion larger than in the business-as-usual forecast. The services sector greatly benefits from reduced gender inequality, gaining US$174 billion in added value compared to the current growth trajectory by 2043.

Reduced gender barriers in the scenario accelerate women's movement from agriculture to other sectors, particularly the service sector. While most women are still employed in agriculture, those in Africa's service sector have been increasing in number partly due to shifting social norms. In the Gender scenario, Africa's GDP per capita is US$355 more than the business-as-usual forecast by 2043, and there are 53 million fewer extremely poor people.

Even more impressive is the illustrative full Gender Equality scenario. It shows an African economy US$1 trillion larger than the Current Path forecast. GDP per capita is 12% higher, and Africa has 80 million fewer people in extreme poverty compared to the Current Path forecast in 2043.

These findings imply that aggressively implementing policies to reduce gender inequality and create a level playing field for all could significantly enhance African growth and development.

Policies must confront deep-rooted cultural and traditional values as the primary cause of gender inequality. Governments should prioritise implementing international and regional conventions to decrease gender disparities, especially in rural areas where discriminatory practices persist unchecked. Involving religious and traditional leaders in awareness campaigns and education is crucial.

Investing in free education up to secondary level could significantly promote gender equality in education. Governments should combat child marriage and teenage pregnancies, ensuring a minimum marriage age of 18 and improving access to contraceptives and sex education. Encouraging girls and women to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics programmes through scholarships and role models can narrow the gender gap in lucrative sectors.

Reproductive health services, legal reforms to address land ownership disparities, and gender-sensitive agricultural programmes are also vital. Removing legal barriers to women's employment, investing in infrastructure that reduces time spent on household production, and extending paternity leave can enhance women's participation in labour and mitigate wage inequality.

Adopting mandatory quotas for female candidates, gender-responsive electoral processes, and mentorship programmes can boost women's political participation. Education on domestic violence and victim support, and legal consequences for perpetrators are essential.

Implementing these measures could decrease gender inequalities in Africa, fostering development and prosperity.

https://allafrica.com/stories/202411250300.html,"South Africa: Masculinity, Femininity, and Queer Identity in the Age of Social Media","What does it mean to be a man, woman, or transgender in South Africa?

The Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) reports that social media conversations about masculine, feminine, and LGBTQIA+ norms are mainly based on varying perceptions of 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' behaviour. The report, An Exploration into Gendered Norms on South African Social Media sheds light on the scope and nature of gender-based violence and femicide among social media users on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Data was collected from social media platform X from 1 January to 31 October 2024. A total of 17 million mentions were found in the dataset (posts, reposts, replies), of which 71% were retweets. There were more than 300,000 unique authors participating in the conversation - each contributing 51 mentions.

According to the CABC, understanding gender norms within the South African context can enable interventions that address harmful norms and practices. The goal is not to identify men as the primary perpetrators of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) but rather to understand the societal and cultural stereotypes that result in the perpetuation of violence against women and children. The Centre believes that when social and gender norms are in place, interventions aimed at educating people about the problem or changing individual attitudes may not be enough to change behaviour.

The researchers found that high-engagement posts in the masculine norms conversation emphasized societal expectations that men should ""lead"", ""provide"" and be ""strong"".

There was a wide range of opinions about women's dress codes and behavior among those highly engaged in the conversation about feminine norms. These included the notion that women should be humble and show respect to men, reports CABC.

The LGBTQIA+, or 'queer norms', conversation suggested that while the community is formally protected, it remains stigmatized in society and that legislative protection has not yet had a normative impact.

Some people argue that their existence is an imposition of Western values, reports CABC.

""Others questioned the constant attacks on the queer community as ""mind boggling"" instead of focusing on issues such as poverty and hunger,"" read the report.

According to the report, it is important to approach the analysis of broad groups with caution, such as the queer community. The report cautioned against placing the entire group under a one-size-fits-all approach. It was also suggested by some that if traditional norms are opened up for questioning, it may result in the degradation of society and established norms, such as underage relationships.

Furthermore, posts concerning the intersection of masculine, feminine, and queer norms were found to question the very existence of the queer community.

According to the report, ""jokes, allegories, and the posting of controversy can normalize negative stereotypes and perceptions, which are informed by and maintain gendered norms"".

Authenticity Questioned

Researchers also found that the online conversation around gender was fuelled by ""engagement farming"" - intentionally sharing controversial posts about women, men, and the LGBTQIA+ community to increase engagement.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/experts-take/2023/09/why-do-women-earn-less,Why do women earn less?,"We cannot talk about gender equality without addressing the stubborn gender pay gap that persists across the globe. In East and Southern Africa women are paid 19% less than men on average, to make up this difference women would need to work 5 hours extra every week. We need to reveal the gap to close the gap, and this is exactly what UN Women’s new report on ‘Why Women Earn Less’ intends to achieve.

Mehjabeen Alarakhia, Women's Economic Empowerment Regional Policy Specialist, UN Women East and Southern Africa Regional Office. Photo: UN Women/James Ochweri

According to the new UN Women report on the Gender Pay Gap in East and Southern Africa, women earn about 81 cents for every US dollar earned by men. Even after accounting for factors like age, education, and job type, women still earn 92 cents less for every US dollar that men earn per hour.

Although the gender pay gap decreases when considering individual and labour-market characteristics, there is still progress needed to achieve equal pay in the region. The pay gap is exacerbated by various underlying causes, including gender stereotypes, discrimination, and limited access to education and employment opportunities for women.

Education plays a crucial role, as women with higher levels of education tend to face a smaller gender pay gap. However, it is concerning that even highly educated women still earn less than their male counterparts. Women with university degrees earn 18% less than men with university degrees, while women with primary school education earn 31% less than men with the same level of education. The occupations and sectors that women engage in also contribute to the gender pay gap, with women often being overrepresented in lower-paying and lower-status jobs. Care sectors such as domestic work, education, and health and social services, are a big source of employment for women in the region (35%). Women’s work in these sectors is undervalued and women are paid 53% lower in domestic work, 25% lower in education and 6.7% lower in health and social work as compared to their male counterparts.

The presence of a ""glass ceiling"" that limits women's advancement to high-paying managerial positions in the region is concerning with the report showing that women in the top 10% of earners face of larger gender pay gap than the average working woman. Efforts should be made to break this barrier and create equal opportunities for women in leadership roles.

The gender pay gap leads to lifetime income inequality between women and men, and further contributes to higher levels of poverty among women. Closing the gender pay gap and addressing other labour-market inequalities is important for improving women’s socioeconomic position and achieving social justice for more than half of the world’s population and contributes to longer term poverty alleviation and human development. Allowing women to use their skills and talents optimally will also benefit the economy, reducing poverty and inequality, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and supporting economic growth as outlined in SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth. It is also worth noting that the gender pay gap cannot be fully explained by differences in job types and personal characteristics alone, as there is still an unexplained portion of the gap. This highlights the need for further investigation and action to address gender-based discrimination and biases.

In conclusion, achieving gender pay equality and addressing labour-market inequalities requires a multifaceted approach involving various stakeholders across the economy. One important aspect is promoting pay transparency, collected at frequent intervals, to understand the gender pay gap and advocate for policies to address it. Public policy efforts should prioritize enhancing educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting women’s participation in high-paying and traditionally male-dominated occupations and sectors, supporting women’s reintegration into the labour force after career breaks, and providing a robust social protection system. Establishing and enforcing labour policies is necessary to ensure equal compensation and equal opportunities for women. Interventions to break down gendered cultural norms are also crucial in reducing the unexplained part of the gender pay gap. Additionally, policies that recognize, reduce, and redistribute women and girls unpaid care work responsibilities complement other efforts to reduce the gender pay gap. By implementing these measures, countries in the region can unlock the full potential of their workforce, fostering socioeconomic advancement, innovation, and sustainable economic growth.

There is increased generation and use of gender disaggregated data in building evidence and ensuring effective policy formulation, programme design and resource mobilization by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), local government (LGs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) within the framework of the Plan for National Statistical Development (PNSD.)

UN Women is supporting the government in creating an enabling environment. National coordination on gender statistics is improving because of establishing technical working groups. Gender is also being mainstreamed in national development plans and statistical development plans to improve monitoring on gender equality.

Increasing data production: The technical capacities of the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS ) and the national statistical system have been strengthened to produce and analyze quality data on time-use, violence against women and girls, and governance, peace, and security, to close key data gaps.

Improving data accessibility and use: A partnership with the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC) has increased the dissemination of data, policy briefs and analytic reports on gender equality. User-producer dialogues are being institutionalized, including the Annual Gender Statistics Forum, and tailor-made trainings on gender statistics are being provided for data users and producers.

UN Women partners with the government and with specific MDAs aligned to the convening role of gender equality: include the Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MFPED), the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), National Planning Authority (NPA), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), Economic Policy Research Center (EPRC), Academia-Makerere University and civil society organizations (CSOs).",un women has invested data statistics specifically capacity building institutionalization mainstreaming generation analysis use gender statistics uganda there increased generation use gender disaggregated data building evidence ensuring effective policy formulation programme design resource mobilization ministries departments agencies mdas local government lgs civil society organizations csos within framework plan national statistical development pnsd un women supporting government creating enabling environment national coordination gender statistics improving because establishing technical working groups gender also mainstreamed national development plans statistical development plans improve monitoring gender equality increasing data production technical capacities uganda bureau statistics ubos national statistical system have strengthened produce analyze quality data timeuse violence against women girls governance peace security close key data gaps improving data accessibility use partnership economic policy research centre eprc has increased dissemination data policy briefs analytic reports gender equality userproducer dialogues institutionalized including annual gender statistics forum tailormade trainings gender statistics provided data users producers un women partners government specific mdas aligned convening role gender equality include ministry gender labour social development mglsd ministry finance planning economic development mfped equal opportunities commission eoc national planning authority npa office prime minister opm uganda bureau statistics ubos economic policy research center eprc academiamakerere university civil society organizations csos
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2018/11/gender-ataya,Media Advisory: UN Women and Key Stakeholders to host Gender Ataya in Dakar,"UN Women is organizing the first edition of ""Gender Ataya"" on Wednesday, November 28, 2018 on the 8th floor of the African Institute of Management (IAM), Dakar.

The Gender Ataya is designed to open spaces for young people to contribute to inclusive and equitable development and decision-making processes within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. It will provide a platform for young people to engage in dialogue with themselves and decision makers including government, CSOs and private sector to share ideas, experiences and innovative approaches for effectively addressing youth development challenges facing Africa.

For far too long, impunity, silence, stigma and shame have led to an entrenched endemic of this human rights violation, gender-based violence around the world. In recent years however, the drive for change had garnered more visibility due largely to the determination and bravery of activists and survivors. The Gender Ataya will ensure that the community is fully engaged and supportive to hold discussions about topics that are usually considered taboo. This inter sectional platform also brings about a multi-sectoral awareness as everyone in society has an important role to play in ending violence against women and girls and we all must work together across sectors to address the various aspects of violence against women and girls.

The commitment to ‘leave no one behind’ has been a key feature of all the discussions on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Towards this end, UN Women, in collaboration with Young Professionals Group and diverse stakeholders and partners, will hold a Gender Ataya Learning Series on Breaking the culture of silence surrounding Violence Against Women.

The Youth (students, youth organizations and associations) have been selected as a primary audience, since they not only are the majority information consumers in terms of digital media, but an audience that fosters possibilities for social transformation through deconstructing the traditionally upheld beliefs about gender roles and acting as change agents to dismantle present counterproductive attitudes in Senegal.

Gender Ataya will be taking place during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, which is an international campaign which takes place each year. It commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day. It is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls. The Campaign’s global advocacy theme this year is: Orange the World: #HearMeToo

Gender Ataya, through the HeforShe Campaign, is dedicated to involving men and boys to be play their part in Gender Equality. HeForShe is an invitation for men and people of all genders to stand in solidarity with women to create a bold, visible and united force for a gender equal world.

The specific conference themes are:

How to engage men and boys in the prevention of Violence Against Women;

How to promote progressive masculinity and debunk gender stereotypes

The role of men and boys in active advocacy against Gender Based Violence

Challenges and resolutions to end domestic violence, education-related violence, and violence in the public space Youth action in preventing violence and other harmful practices against young women and girls; and Showcasing and documenting youth-led social innovations addressing gender-based violence women, girls and youth in Africa. Inter generational and inter community dialogue and learning to end violence against women

Through an interactive dialogue, the breakfast meeting was an opportunity to reflect on the role of the media, CSOs and other influencers in shaping and transforming negative social norms and stereotypes which exacerbate gender inequality, tolerate gender-based violence and impede effective enjoyment by women of their human rights agreed to in national policies and laws.

Rwanda has recorded significant gains in promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in the country. Reports show that there has been unprecedented progress in gender equality on social-economic transformation and transformational governance. However, there are still prevailing challenges in achieving full gender equality and empowerment of women, rooted in negative social norms and gender stereotypes which, if not properly addressed, will continue to perpetrate inequalities and gender-based violence.

Social and gender norms being standards and rules that most members of societies agree upon, media plays a key role in reshaping norms positively using their power and influence. Through a breakfast meeting themed “The Role of Media in Shaping Social and Gender Norms”, UN Women Rwanda brought together reporters and journalists from different media houses, social media influencers, members of the civil society organizations, UN agencies, members of Parliament and representatives of different Government institutions to discuss existing negative social norms that hinder gender equality promotion and define strategies to address them.

As Guest of Honor at the event, Prof. Jeannette Bayisenge, Minister of Gender and Family Promotion applauded UN Women for bringing together media, CSOs and influencers on this important subject, noting the critical role these actors play in information dissemination at a wider scale, in advocacy and in shaping how people think, behave, socialize, and act. She urged the media to make full use of its powerful role in promoting gender equality, family cohesion and the well-being of Rwandans. “Addressing social norms and gender stereotypes embedded in our cultural beliefs and patriarchal society cannot be done overnight. It's rather a process that requires a mindset shift and concerted efforts by different stakeholders"" she noted.

Welcoming the participants, UN Women Country Representative Ms. Jennet Kem commended the Government of Rwanda for advancing gender equality. “As we work towards dismantling patriarchal negative norms, it is important to reshape society to embrace and promote positive social norms that contribute to gender equality. Today’s meeting is a crucial moment for us to build on gender gains in Rwanda, reflect on innovative ways and strategies to address persistent negative social norms and gender stereotypes, and commit to sustainably addressing them.” Ms. Kem noted calling upon the media and other partners to join efforts in this light.

Opening the event on behalf of the One UN Country Team, Mr. Ozonnia, the UN resident Coordinator in Rwanda, stressed: “The Media has the power to challenge negative social norms, gender stereotypes, harmful practices, and negative cultural beliefs which continue to condone gender inequalities that increase gender-based violence,” said Mr. Ozonnia Ojielo, UN Resident Coordinator in Rwanda while officiating the event. He also reiterated that gender equality and women’s empowerment are among the One UN’s top priorities and recommitted to working closely with the Government of Rwanda, UN Women, and different partners, including the media, CSOs, and other key players to deliver on gender equality and women’s empowerment agenda, and in particular, on this journey to challenge the social norms, negative cultural beliefs, patriarchal attitudes, gender stereotypes, and GBV.

A panel of seasoned experts in the field of gender equality, comprising Mr. Silas Ngayaboshya, Director General of Gender Promotion and Women Empowerment from the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF), Mr. Fidele Rutayisire, Executive Director of RWAMREC, Ms. Gaudence Mushimiyimana, Executive Director of UNABU drove the discussions on the role of the media in shaping social and gender norms.

Panelists during a discussion on the role of media and public influencers in promoting positive social norms.

According to a survey conducted by RWAMREC, 56% of men fear that they would not be needed at home if their wives were financially independent. Mr. Fidele Rutayisire, Executive Director of RWAMREC said that “This is one of many negative social norms that hinder our efforts to empower women economically.” Another example shared during the discussions is the higher number of women holding positions of Vice Mayors in charge of social affairs in Districts. “It is an achievement to have women in leadership positions. However, it is still believed that they perform better than men in dealing with social affairs than in economic or other technical affairs.” DG Ngayaboshya sharing the experiences they face in the efforts to change mindsets on gender equality, emphasized that men and women should not choose careers based on their gender, rather on their capacities.

Speaking at the media panel, Ms. Gaudence Uwamariya, Executive Secretary of UNABU, a local NGO that represents women with disabilities brought into perspective the negative social norms on people living with disabilities, in particular women, and invited media and public influencers to be keen in disability inclusion in their advocacy. She said that media should not contribute to victimizing people with disabilities, especially women and girls. “Women with disabilities face discrimination because men think they are not able to perform their roles in their homes, such as cooking, taking care of kids, and working in the fields, among other chores,” Ms. Uwamariya noted. She encouraged media to contribute to mindset shift and attitudes towards people living with disabilities through sensitization to remove barriers for girls and boys and allow them to enjoy their full rights as human beings,”

Furthermore, Ms. Murebwayire Shafiga, Rwanda Investigation Division Manager of the gender-based violence crime division, presented the state of violence against women in the country, which indicated a rise in GBV incidents however, there was also an increasing trend in reporting. She said that the media is doing well in communication and advocacy, especially around, GBV but the choice of words should be thoughtful to avoid the re-victimization of victims. “Media should be mindful of what information should be in public to avoid distorting evidence and protect victims.”

Considering the high expectations from the media as expressed during the meeting, Edmond Kagire, a seasoned journalist, and social media influencer acknowledged that the media plays a role in fueling negative norms in both news coverage, profiling the subjects and in the choice of words either on microphone or on paper. “There is a strong need of media training and gender-sensitive reporting guidelines to help us take the right path on this journey,” Kagire said. He also expressed commitment on behalf of his fellow media practitioners to challenge the status quo. “We acknowledge our important role in reshaping the social and gender norms, and from what was discussed here, I believe those who attended today’s meeting will become agents of change in our newsrooms and on our social media platforms in collaboration with UN Women guidance,” Kagire noted.

Through open dialogues, panelists and participants exchanged personal experiences to highlight the impact of negative social norms and gender stereotypes both in their areas of work as well as their everyday life. They also proposed a range of recommendations on how to address them and bring positive change in society.

In her closing remarks, Ms. Jennet Kem, UN Women Rwanda Representative reiterated that not all social norms are bad and that ending negative social norms is not a fight between men and women. “This is an issue that both genders need to work on together. Let us create accountability mechanisms for gender-sensitive reporting,” she concluded.

Among many others, Ms. Juliet Karitanyi, a communication expert who attended the breakfast meeting, proposed the creation of an online document that will help to list the negative social norms that condone gender inequalities, adding that this will help in addressing them properly.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/news/2022/08/men-engage-to-ensure-women-and-girls-access-sexual-and-reproductive-health-rights-in-humanitarian-settings-in-ethiopia,Men engage to ensure women and girls access sexual and reproductive health rights in humanitarian settings in Ethiopia,"By addressing harmful gender norms through promoting positive masculinity, engaging husbands, fathers and other men, we improve women’s status, and improve the quality of life for all. This was one of the key messages outlined during the advocacy workshop that was held in Ethiopia as part of UN Women’s programme on adolescent health rights in humanitarian settings in the Horn of Africa Region (POWER), which is supported by the Austrian Development Agency.

POWER aims to contribute to every woman, every child, and every adolescent girl, demanding her right to quality health services, particularly in humanitarian settings. The training focused on strengthening the participants’ capacity to advocate for and enhance SRMNCAH (sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health) service utilization among women and girls, deal with gender barriers and address gender inequality across all levels to access SRMNCAH services.

More than half of the participants were men: men from different provinces, representing different organizations – ministries and CSOs, educational background and family status. What was uniting them was their keen interest in the subject of gender-based violence and gender equality in humanitarian settings, extensive knowledge of cultural norms, experience working in the field of sexual and reproductive health, and unwavering commitment to challenging social norms to make their communities and the country a place where women and girls are safe and exercise their rights.

UN Women sat down for a brief interview with three participants and this is what they had to say.

Regen Mohammed, AYSRHR Officer, EngenderHealth, Ethiopia

There are various sociocultural barriers such as restrictive norms and stigma about adolescent and youth sexuality, harmful gender norms, and discrimination by communities, families, partners, and providers. Men have minimal knowledge about SRMNCAH. As a result, men don't support their wives to access SRMNCAH services. Generally, the culture is not supportive of utilization of some of the SRMNCAH services, especially family planning services. As a result, the community doesn't have a positive attitude towards family planning, and men and elders don't want their wives to limit the number of children.

For young women it is also hard to access services, again due to the cultural norms and perception. If a schoolgirl starts visiting sexual and reproductive health clinics, people will think “Oh, this girl started having sex already,” and therefore they are afraid to go and ask, they prefer to manage these issues in silence.

EngenderHealth understands and values the pivotal role men and boys play in promoting gender equality and ensuring positive SRH outcomes. We have programmes promoting positive masculinity and engaging men and boys in sexual and reproductive health awareness raising. We also believe parents should be educated and we have Parent-Teacher-Student counselor, who helps raise awareness on any issues that female students face, especially on issues related to SRHR, and we engage Ethiopian Youth Advisory Council volunteers. This person helps a lot with issues that are culturally sensitive.

I started my career as a teacher, and I saw challenges that young girls face and could feel their pain. This made me conscious about issues of menstrual hygiene, their health, and limitations that girls in our country face, and it was logical for me to join EngenderHealth as SRHR Officer. It is still sometimes difficult when my male friends laugh at me and my job. But I always challenge them back asking how they are helping their mothers, sisters, wives, and try to educate them about issues women face in Ethiopia and their role, as men.

I personally walk the talk by doing my equal part in household chores and taking care of my child. My wife is a nurse, and she also works. When I get home from work, I am the one who looks after our son: changing diapers, feeding him, washing clothes and cleaning the house. I believe it is necessary to support our wives so they can also strive in their careers.

Lack of education, lack of resources, child marriage, harmful cultural norms- these are some of the barriers women and girls face when trying to access services and exercise their rights. During crises, women’s and girls’ rights need more attention, because other urgent priorities come first, the investments are channeled to mitigate crises and women’s situation get worsened.

Ethiopia is a big and diverse country. Cultural norms differ from one province to another. There is no one pill that will work for all.

However, I think there are few approaches that will be relevant to all provinces to address issues of child marriage, FGM, gender inequality and access to sexual and reproductive health.

First, we need to reach local communities and work with them, including but not limited to elders, traditional leaders, to tackle harmful practices there and to approach these issues holistically. One regular social worker who can be stationed in that community could help raise awareness on all aspect of life of women in the community: from healthy nutrition, to education and existing services (medical, legal). Just to give an idea, I once came to know that 500 women came to donate blood at IWSD event. This is the result of women having to get married early, bearing children as teen mothers, heavy workload at home, prioritizing their husbands’ nutrition, looking after children. These young women were simply exhausted. This experience struck me to the cord and made me think that we cannot support women and girls’ rights, if we do not look at these issues holistically: nutrition, lack of knowledge, heavy workload at home, and harmful practices that lead to early marriage and teen pregnancies and power imbalance.

It is important that we engage men in a meaningful way. We have to look at the interventions that will look at the root cause of women’s hindered ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR)—gender inequality and changing men’s mindset in this area is important. Men should be part of the solution by sharing the household chores, doing their part in childcare, allowing their wives to get education and look after themselves. Above all, men should not decide to marry children.

Developing programs that effectively engage men to advance gender equality, challenge inequities, and promote access to SRHR services, may not be easy. But working in the communities, and step by step, by working together as one- government agencies, donors, partners, men and boys – we can make a meaningful change.

To enhance women’s access to services, we need a multi-sectoral approach where different ministries and departments address issues holistically because issues are interlinked. UN Women has been instrumental in bringing us together and building platforms for us to collaborate, to ensure that every woman, every girl in refugee camps and host communities know of their rights and can freely exercise them.

One of the sessions that we are tackling today is engaging men and boys. Evidence shows that the work with men and boys in the context of sexual and reproductive health can bring transformative results. Together with UN Women, through this project we are working to remove structural, sociocultural and individual barriers, by making sure we have policies in place, by working with communities to minimize stigma and harmful gender norms and by educating women and communities about SRMNCAH, and dismantling myth and misconceptions around family planning and gender-based violence.

The Advocacy workshop was part of the POWER programme implemented in Uganda and Ethiopia – countries that host most of the refugees in the Horn of Africa. It focuses on three outcomes specifically in refugee camps and host communities: ensuring there are frameworks that take into consideration women’s and girls’ access to SRMNCAH services in humanitarian settings; improved gender norms and practices; and empowered women and girls to exercise their rights to services. Education, awareness raising and community work in refugee camps and host communities are critical elements of the programme.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the second largest country in Africa and has a total population of 67.8 million people, of which 51% are women and 48% of the total population is below 15 years old. Despite being endowed with extraordinary natural resources, the DRC remains one of the poorest countries in the world, classified 186th out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index (UNDP, 2010). Over 70% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.

Decades of armed conflict have led to the deaths of over 2 million civilians and estimates suggest over 1 million women have been raped. Though articles 5, 14 and 15 of the DRC constitution establish a legal basis for equality and equity policies, women currently occupy only 7.2% of positions at the highest level of decision making at a national level in the parliament and government.

Up to 52% of women in DRC are survivors of domestic violence and 39% of Congolese women report having being threatened or injured. 27% of women in DRC are victims of harmful traditional practices. Early marriage is common, with 2007 reports indicting 39% of women in their early twenties were married or in a union before the age of 18.

Very few Congolese women have access to decent jobs, and in general women and girls have less access to education than men and boys, as well as higher rates of illiteracy.

UN Women DRC has a country office in the capital, Kinshasha and a sub-office in Bakavu in South Kivu province.

Our Programmes

Gender responsive planning and budgeting

In partnership with UNDP, we are enhancing the capacity of the DRC government to undertake gender-responsive planning and budgeting. We provide technical support to the government on gender mainstreaming in budget development processes; strengthen the capacity of various government departments on gender responsive budgeting, support national and provincial women’s organizations to monitor gender-related and women empowerment commitments and action research on gender responsive budgeting.

Ending violence against women and girls

We provide technical support to the Ministry of Gender for effective coordination and implementation of the national strategy on Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV), especially in the areas of communications and monitoring and evaluation. Our programme supports the review process of the family law to ensure alignment with international and regional conventions especially on the age of marriage as early marriage is widespread in the DRC.

Women, peace and security

We support the Ministry of Gender to implement the government’s Resolution 1325 National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security. This includes supporting the establishment of the multi-donor trust fund; supporting conflict resolution action plans; supporting gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations and security sector reforms; supporting capacity for female leaders/gender advocates to participate in formal peace processes and conflict resolution processes, and supporting women’s participation in post-conflict humanitarian processes.

Women’s political leadership and participation

We support implementing affirmative action favoring women’s access to decision-making positions through parity bills or special measures and encourage parliaments and political parties to understand the importance of female leadership and political participation. We strengthen the leadership skills of female parliamentarians, female academics and young women leaders. We provide civic and voter education; favor recruitment of women for high placement on political party lists; monitor the minimum quota of 30% in the Electoral Administration and provide gender mainstreaming support of the electoral commission.

Women’s economic empowerment and female entrepreneurship

Reducing the economic vulnerability of women can contribute to the prevention of violence against women and girls. We provide technical assistance to government ministries to implement gender action plans; advocate for female entrepreneurs and farmers to access production and market and information and services and conduct small demonstration projects in eastern DRC. We also work with ministries to promote access to gender-sensitive infrastructure and services and support rural women, informal traders and women entrepreneurs’ access training and professional services.",rdc democratic republic congo drc second largest country africa has total population million people which women total population below years old despite endowed extraordinary natural resources drc remains one poorest countries world classified th countries human development index undp population lives below poverty threshold decades armed conflict have led deaths million civilians estimates suggest million women have raped though articles drc constitution establish legal basis equality equity policies women currently occupy positions highest level decision making national level parliament government women drc survivors domestic violence congolese women report having threatened injured women drc victims harmful traditional practices early marriage common reports indicting women early twenties married union age very few congolese women have access decent jobs general women girls have less access education men boys well higher rates illiteracy un women drc has country office capital kinshasha suboffice bakavu south kivu province programmes gender responsive planning budgeting partnership undp enhancing capacity drc government undertake genderresponsive planning budgeting provide technical support government gender mainstreaming budget development processes strengthen capacity various government departments gender responsive budgeting support national provincial womens organizations monitor genderrelated women empowerment commitments action research gender responsive budgeting ending violence against women girls provide technical support ministry gender effective coordination implementation national strategy sexual genderbased violence sgbv especially areas communications monitoring evaluation programme supports review process family law ensure alignment international regional conventions especially age marriage early marriage widespread drc women peace security support ministry gender implement governments resolution national action plan women peace security includes supporting establishment multidonor trust fund supporting conflict resolution action plans supporting gender mainstreaming peacekeeping operations security sector reforms supporting capacity female leadersgender advocates participate formal peace processes conflict resolution processes supporting womens participation postconflict humanitarian processes womens political leadership participation support implementing affirmative action favoring womens access decisionmaking positions through parity bills special measures encourage parliaments political parties understand importance female leadership political participation strengthen leadership skills female parliamentarians female academics young women leaders provide civic voter education favor recruitment women high placement political party lists monitor minimum quota electoral administration provide gender mainstreaming support electoral commission womens economic empowerment female entrepreneurship reducing economic vulnerability women contribute prevention violence against women girls provide technical assistance government ministries implement gender action plans advocate female entrepreneurs farmers access production market information services conduct small demonstration projects eastern drc also work ministries promote access gendersensitive infrastructure services support rural women informal traders women entrepreneurs access training professional services

UN Women in Africa has led the effort to engage with cultural and traditional community leaders in ending harmful practices impacting women and girls. Evidence-based engagement proved that working with community leaders is essential for effectively changing social norms.

Traditional leaders have been catalysts for change against child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) through being influencers for dropping some customary and traditional laws and practices and by engaging with their communities to end them.

At least one in three young women in Africa are married before they turn 18 (UNICEF,2006). Although there are signs of small progress in changing attitudes toward FGM, the practice remains a major problem across many countries on the continent. About 200 million girls and women have been subjected to the practice (UNICEF,2006).

Traditional leaders across Africa are playing significant roles as influencers and custodians of cultural practices within communities. As attention grows to the slow progress on ending Gender-Based Violence, including early child marriage (ECM) and FGM, traditional leaders have a critical role in shifting deep-rooted cultural beliefs that perpetuate harmful practices.",timeline story un women africa has led effort engage cultural traditional community leaders ending harmful practices impacting women girls evidencebased engagement proved working community leaders essential effectively changing social norms traditional leaders have catalysts change against child marriage female genital mutilation fgm through influencers dropping customary traditional laws practices engaging communities end least one three young women africa married turn unicef although there signs small progress changing attitudes toward fgm practice remains major problem across many countries continent million girls women have subjected practice unicef traditional leaders across africa playing significant roles influencers custodians cultural practices within communities attention grows slow progress ending genderbased violence including early child marriage ecm fgm traditional leaders have critical role shifting deeprooted cultural beliefs perpetuate harmful practices

They have organizational, technical and institutional capacity, and contribute, through citizen participation, to improving governance management and accountability, and advancing the gender equality agenda in the country.

To understand how to better support women's organizations in civil society, the Ministry of Gender, Family and Children has made it its duty to map the quintessence of the women's movement in the Democratic Republic of Congo and thus launched, with the support of UN Women and AWLN, a mapping exercise in the 145 territories of the 26 provinces of the DRC.

Following the mapping, which was achieved through an online questionnaire to all the territories, a National Forum of Women's Civil Society Organizations and Associations (OFSCs) took place in September 2023, and brought together key actors in the gender sector, namely: technical and financial partners, the SNU and the national party as well as experts in the field of gender.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/eastern-and-southern-africa/somalia,Where we are : Eastern and Southern Africa : Somalia,"Somalia population comprises of a significant youth and adolescent population with under half (45.6%) of the population being less than 15 years and around three-quarters (75%) of the population being less than 30 years old

Somalia’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has consistently been ranked among the five lowest in the world throughout the last decade and in 2020 it was the second lowest in the world. In 2019, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated the labour force participation of men (15-64) to be 73.6% while women’s (15-64) labour force participation rate was estimated to be 23.1% with the figures remaining relatively unchanged over the past 10 years. Agriculture remains the biggest employer of both men and women at 79.2% and 83.9% of the labour force respectively.

Over the past two decades, Somalia has experienced a raging civil war, a rise in violent extremism and a devastating humanitarian crisis, which resulted in weak institutional and bureaucratic infrastructure and has greatly damaged social cohesion and unity. For decades, conflict, insecurity and natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones, floods, desert locust and COVID-19 have made Somalia a difficult and volatile humanitarian crisis. Somalia has one of the largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the world, with displacement driven by the conflict with al-Shabab, fear of violence, drought, lack of livelihood opportunities and evictions. A total of 7.7 million Somali women, men, and children are estimated to require humanitarian assistance in 2022.

Life for women and girls in Somalia is challenging. Somalia ranks fourth lowest for gender equality globally, maternal and infant mortality rates are some of the highest in the world, and early marriage is prevalent. The Somalia Health and Demographic Survey (SHDS) shows that Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) in women aged 15–49 is high, at 99.2%which has both short-term and long-term physiological, sexual and psychological repercussions. Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is one of the most prevalent human rights violations faced by people, particularly women, all around the globe. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, women, and girls have faced an even greater risk of SGBV. To address some of the challenges, in 2018, the Federal Parliament introduced the comprehensive Sexual Offences Bill (SOB), which if approved during the 11th Parliament, would offer greater protection for the victims of sexual violence and would represent a significant step toward ending the culture of impunity as it relates to GBV in Somalia.

In the Somali context, exclusionary politics has been a historic driver of conflict. Given the male-dominated clan system and the absence of a systematic approach to promote inclusivity, Somali women largely remain excluded from key political and decision-making processes, despite the complex they continue to play in conflict, peace, and security. They continue to remain underrepresented within national and regional decision and making policy-making bodies. Gender imbalance in political participation, in leadership and decision-making, is a threat to sustained peace and development. Despite commitments to 30% quota for women in the 11th Parliamentary elections (2021-2022), the women’s representation stands low at 20% in House of the People, which is lower than the 2016 figure of 24%. There were some gains made with 26% seats for women in Upper House in 11th Parliament in comparison to 24% in 10th Parliament.

Despite the positive trajectory towards stability, there continue to be numerous attacks in both urban and rural areas, carried out by militant groups in Somalia. The limited capacities at all levels of government to provide for the security, protection, social, environmental, and economic needs of the population specifically women pose an additional challenge to the promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE) in Somalia.

Other aspects of the challenges that women face in accessing justice are the Somali culture, which restricts women to the home and family sphere; differing interpretations of judicial regimes, like sharia, secular and customary law; and the absence of women within the judicial system. Out of a total of 295 judges there exist 2 female judges and out of a total of 65 prosecutors 14 female prosecutors as of 2021 calling for attention for gender parity.

About UN Women in Somalia In Somalia, UN Women supports and works closely with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes, and services needed to ensure that the gender equality standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls. The UN Women Somalia programme (2022-2025) is derived from the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework Guiding Principles and Guidance, Somalia Common Country Analysis (CCA), and the CCA companion document by SDG, UN Somalia Gender Equality Strategy, and the National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325, UN Women Africa Strategy and the NDP-9 Pillars focusing on promoting women’s political participation and leadership and women, peace and security agenda with strengthening women’s access to justice, promoting durable solutions; gender in humanitarian action and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence with the focus on women IDPs and refugees, climate resilience, and advancing women’s economic empowerment adopting the triple nexus.

https://allafrica.com/stories/202403130030.html,Uganda: Africa's Renewable Energy Sector Is Shattering Gender Norms,"Africa's fast-evolving renewable energy landscape is catalysing a shift in gender dynamics, with more women seizing employment opportunities than in the traditional energy sector, according to a new report.

According to the report, ""more women are assuming positions as business creators, energy producers, distributors, and service providers,"" challenging longstanding gender norms prevalent in the energy industry.

The report, ""Empowering Women in Clean Energy: Advancing and Retaining an Equitable Workforce"", by The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet draws insights from over 150 female professionals employed at different levels in the renewable energy sector.

Traditionally, the energy sector has been male-dominated, with women representing a mere 16% of its workforce globally, despite constituting 39% of the labour force, according to the IEA. However, in the renewable energy realm, the tide is turning rapidly, with more women assuming roles ranging from entry-level positions to leadership roles, challenging entrenched gender norms.

""A powerful transformation is underway in the African clean energy sector, as companies are making explicit efforts to hire and retain women at every level,"" Makena Ireri, the Director of Demand Jobs and Livelihoods at GEAPP, explains.

According to Ireri, this shift is especially significant because ""women experience the greatest repercussions of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities.""

From e-mobility companies to off-grid solar solution companies to leading clean energy transition funds, women are proving to be vital drivers of the clean energy transition both at the country level and continentally.

In South Africa, for instance, the Dorper Wind Farm is a prime example of successful women-led ventures in the clean energy sector. Spearheaded by CEO Mamosa May, the 100 MW wind farm is located in the Eastern Cape. There are plans to ramp up generation at the farm to 500 MW of wind power, an achievement that could make it one of the largest wind farms in Africa.

Besides, Rekik Bekele, an Ethiopian woman leader who is the CEO and founder of Green Scene Energy, is also another shining example of women leaders in the renewable energy sector.

Green Scene Energy facilitates farmers' access to affordable, high quality off-grid solar power. According to their website, they have recently launched a pay-as-you-go scheme partnering with Ethio Telecom.

Such ambitious developments are critical for energy thirst markets such as Ethiopia, where electrification rates are less than 60% and close to 60 million people live without access to electricity, according to Energypedia.

Bekele was listed among the 25 Under 40 Energy Women Rising Stars of 2023 by the Africa Energy Chamber.

Besides, a rising number of women-centered initiatives are offering clean energy solutions, prioritizing female involvement and generating employment opportunities, particularly in lower-level roles.

Solar Sister is one such initiative that recruits, trains and supports women entrepreneurs in rural communities to build businesses that bring solar energy solutions to their communities.

Successful enterprises sell off-grid solar equipment directly to people without power, consequently earning income. According to its website, more than 10,000 successful enterprises have been established by this initiative in Nigeria and Tanzania, its primary markets.

Additionally, M-Kopa, one of the largest PAYG solar service companies in Africa, highlights in its 2023 impact report that 43% of its sales agents across Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa are women.

More women are expected to be employed in the clean energy sector in the future, with more companies integrating a range of initiatives that promise to upscale their involvement.

The GEAPP report highlights that companies are adopting more inclusive practices such as flexible working hours, implementing safety measures, and hiring women into traditionally male-dominated roles.

""This is due to increased donor interest, the coalescing around gender criteria for investments, and a growing understanding that a more diverse workforce results in improved business outcomes for companies,"" the authors of the report explain.

Past inequalities go beyond representation, extending to gaps in wages and earnings. The IEA highlights that in the traditional energy sector set up, the wages of female employees were almost 20% lower than for male employees.

However, according to GEAPP, the earnings of women in the renewable energy sector, especially those in leadership roles, are also improving.

""Women's earnings average 95% of men's earnings for similar roles and jobs in the sector,"" the report highlights.

A 2023 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects that accelerating the energy transition can add 40 million jobs in the energy sector by 2050.

Notably, closing the gender gap in employment could significantly increase GDP and enhance productivity and competitiveness in Africa.

The McKinsey Global Institute has found that if women were to participate in the economy at the same rate as men, their contributions could add as much as USD 28 trillion globally.",africas fastevolving renewable energy landscape catalysing shift gender dynamics women seizing employment opportunities traditional energy sector according new report according report women assuming positions business creators energy producers distributors service providers challenging longstanding gender norms prevalent energy industry report empowering women clean energy advancing retaining equitable workforce global energy alliance people planet draws insights female professionals employed different levels renewable energy sector traditionally energy sector has maledominated women representing mere workforce globally despite constituting labour force according iea however renewable energy realm tide turning rapidly women assuming roles ranging entrylevel positions leadership roles challenging entrenched gender norms powerful transformation underway african clean energy sector companies making explicit efforts hire retain women every level makena ireri director demand jobs livelihoods geapp explains according ireri shift especially significant because women experience greatest repercussions climate change which amplifies existing gender inequalities emobility companies offgrid solar solution companies leading clean energy transition funds women proving vital drivers clean energy transition both country level continentally south africa instance dorper wind farm prime example successful womenled ventures clean energy sector spearheaded ceo mamosa may mw wind farm located eastern cape there plans ramp generation farm mw wind power achievement could make one largest wind farms africa besides rekik bekele ethiopian woman leader who ceo founder green scene energy also another shining example women leaders renewable energy sector green scene energy facilitates farmers access affordable high quality offgrid solar power according website have recently launched payasyougo scheme partnering ethio telecom ambitious developments critical energy thirst markets ethiopia where electrification rates less close million people live without access electricity according energypedia bekele listed among under energy women rising stars africa energy chamber besides rising number womencentered initiatives offering clean energy solutions prioritizing female involvement generating employment opportunities particularly lowerlevel roles solar sister one initiative recruits trains supports women entrepreneurs rural communities build businesses bring solar energy solutions communities successful enterprises sell offgrid solar equipment directly people without power consequently earning income according website successful enterprises have established initiative nigeria tanzania primary markets additionally mkopa one largest payg solar service companies africa highlights impact report sales agents across kenya uganda nigeria ghana south africa women women expected employed clean energy sector future companies integrating range initiatives promise upscale involvement geapp report highlights companies adopting inclusive practices flexible working hours implementing safety measures hiring women traditionally maledominated roles due increased donor interest coalescing around gender criteria investments growing understanding diverse workforce results improved business outcomes companies authors report explain close sign free allafrica newsletters get latest african news delivered straight inbox top headlines women uganda energy submitting above agree privacy policy success almost finished need confirm email address complete process please follow instructions email sent error error there problem processing submission please try again later past inequalities go beyond representation extending gaps wages earnings iea highlights traditional energy sector set wages female employees almost lower male employees however according geapp earnings women renewable energy sector especially leadership roles also improving womens earnings average mens earnings similar roles jobs sector report highlights report international renewable energy agency irena projects accelerating energy transition add million jobs energy sector notably closing gender gap employment could significantly increase gdp enhance productivity competitiveness africa mckinsey global institute has found women participate economy same rate men contributions could add much usd trillion globally
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/news/2023/02/what-is-female-genital-mutilation-and-how-is-un-women-working-to-end-it-in-esaro,Your questions answered: What is female genital mutilation and how is UN Women working to end it in East and Southern Africa?,"About 200 million girls and women globally have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM), which is a form of violence against women and girls. FGM continues in more than half of the countries on the African continent, although there are small signs of progress in raising awareness on the harms of FGM and changing attitudes which tolerate the harmful practice. Under the 2030 Agenda, UN Member States have committed to end FGM by 2030 (SDG Target 5.3). UN Women works to support this result by promoting stronger partnerships and collective action, centered on the rights of women and girls and the gender inequality and unequal power relations at the root of the practice.

What is female genital mutilation?

FGM is a form of violence against women which entails the ‘partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to female genital organs for non-medical reasons’ and is normally carried out between infancy and age 15. There are four types of FGM; the most dangerous one being infibulations, which is the total removal of the clitoris, and the labia and the vagina are stitched together with only a small hole to urinate and menstruate. The practice is harmful and has no health benefits. It has numerous immediate and long-term health consequences, including infections and abnormal scarring, debilitating pain, childbirth complications or death.

Over 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone genital mutilation, and small-scale studies, media reports and anecdotal evidence suggest FGM may be present in more than 90 countries. In East and Southern Africa, it is prevalent in countries, such as Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia (up to 99 per cent), Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.[1]

Why is it practiced?

Evidence shows that this practice is caused by deep rooted inequality between men and women, patriarchal beliefs and harmful social norms, poverty and lack of education and awareness.

The reasons behind FGM can be different from one country to another and the age when girls are cut varies. In some communities it is seen as a rite of passage into womanhood, in others it is a way to ensure women’s “purity” for her future husband, and a way to suppress her sexual desires. Many families believe that FGM increases women’s marriageability and is good for girls’ future.

“Why are we being told that as girls, when we get cut, we bring honour?” asks Natalie. “That is not the truth. It is very painful, some girls die. Or, we get married. Our lives are basically taken away from us.”



What are the consequences of FGM for women and girls?

FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways, both with immediate and long-term complications. Women share their story of FGM as being their worst nightmare, experiencing severe pain, excessive bleeding (hemorrhage), in some cases leading to death. Long-term complications can include pain during urination, painful menstruations, pain during sexual intercourse, difficulties during childbirth, etc. Women who have undergone genital mutilation also reported about the psychological impacts. The physical and psychological consequences of FGM can also negatively affect women’s educational outcomes, their economic empowerment and social engagement.

What needs to be done to end this practice?

Comprehensive approaches and partnerships across actors to address gender discrimination and social norms are essential to bring an end to FGM. Efforts must centre on the rights of women and girls to have control over their bodies and live free of violence and include: passing and strengthening laws that ban FGM (including related to cross-border FGM); ensuring systematic data collection and monitoring of the practice; investing resources to implement laws and policies; supporting comprehensive services for women and girls who have undergone the practice; working with communities to understand drivers of the practice and change harmful social norms; expand community education and awareness raising and build a shared accountability to end the practice. All actors have a role to shift attitudes related to FGM and it is important to support women’s rights organizations and advocates who have been leading the work and deepen collaboration with influential actors such as religious and traditional leaders, as well as men, boys and parents to champion a future free of FGM.



What is UN Women doing to put an end to female genital mutilation in East and Southern Africa?

UN Women believes that investing in preventing this practice and other forms of violence against women and girls is a critical investment for upholding the rights of women and girls. UN Women works at various levels engaging partners in the communities and countries across the region to help change social norms:

We work with partners to address the issue from a holistic, strategic perspective. Ending FGM is one of the Collective Commitments under the Generation Equality Action Coalition on Gender-Based Violence. Two of the Action Coalition leaders, the Government of Kenya and YES! Trust Zimbabwe (youth organization) are from East and Southern Africa. In 2022, UN Women convened GBV Action Coalition leaders and commitment makers from the region to share progress and identify advocacy priorities, including related to ending FGM. Key priorities for ending FGM included taking action on existing regional and national laws and policies, advocating for increased resources on the issue supporting efforts of local anti-FGM activists and organizations, strengthening engagement with adolescents and collaboration across initiatives, such as the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme on Ending FGM.

We partner with traditional leaders, including cultural and religious authorities, who are using their influence, knowledge, and power to put an end to FGM and other harmful practices, and promote gender equality in their communities.

With support from the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, we are working with local civil society and women’s rights organizations to drive out the practice of FGM, such as in Uganda. The programme uses an evidence-based community mobilization approach created by the Ugandan NGO Raising Voices called “SASA!” –that has shown success in changing harmful social norms, which has been implemented in 30 countries, in Africa and other regions.

In Somalia, with support from the Government of Japan (LEAP programme), UN Women is engaging elders, religious leaders, women, men and young people in joint advocacy and improving access to services to end FGM and other forms of gender-based violence. The approach includes community outreach and activities to transform harmful social norms and attitudes.

At the end of the meeting, African leaders agreed to follow the newly launched “Partnership Guidelines” with key recommendations to traditional and faith leaders to respond to gender-based violence in Africa.

Traditional and religious leaders in Africa play significant roles as custodians of cultural practices within their communities. Considering their key role, UN Women, through the Spotlight Initiative Africa Regional Program (SIARP), in collaboration with the AUC and in partnership with the EU Delegation to the AU, launched the ""Partnership Guidelines to Support Engagement between the African Union and Traditional and Regional Leaders” with key recommendations to respond to Gender-Based Violence in the continent.

As UN Women, we have recognized early on the importance of working with men and boys as allies and active agents of change to achieve gender equality by establishing and supporting the pan-African continental movement of progressive traditional, religious and cultural leaders such as COTLA[1]”, stated Ms. Awa Ndiaye Seck, Special Representative of UN Women Liaison Office to the African Union, in her opening remarks. The UN Women representative also highlighted the importance of operationalize the “Guidelines” and build the capacity of traditional leaders to change the deep-rooted cultural beliefs that perpetuate violence.

Ms. Victoria Maloka, Head of the Coordination and Outreach Division of Women, Gender, Development and Youth Directorate (WGYD) at AUC, emphasized the remarkable role traditional leaders play in preventing violence: “As AUC, we recognize the centrality of traditional and religious leaders in fighting gender-based violence. Traditional and religious leaders are gatekeepers of our African identity, culture and customs”.

On behalf of Head of Policy Cooperation at the EU Delegation to the AU, Ms. Amandine Duhoux, Attachée of the EU Delegation to the AU, stressed that “The European Union is the first investor in gender equality around the world, and Africa is at the heart of the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative. We are here today to ensure that religious and traditional leaders’ voices are heard during the 2nd Men's Conference on Positive Masculinity.”

""We must walk the talk""

King Adedapo Aderemi of Nigeria, Convenor General of COTLA, and a key ally in the fight to end violence and challenging practices of violence, went to the stage as representative of the Traditional leaders to receive the “Guidelines”, expressing his commitment in calling out violence, standing in support with survivors and advocating for change: “We need to walk to the talk and to seek accountability to those who promote and practice violence in our continent. Together with UN Women and other partners in the continent, we will end violence against women and girls”.

The meeting provided the ideal platform build a systematic engagement between and amongst regional faith-based organizations, communities of traditional leaders, and the AUC and sealed the commitment of traditional leaders in strengthening their engagement in prevention and response to violence in their communities.

Hosted by UN Women, the two-day meeting also provided a platform for traditional leaders to voice their Generation Equality commitments: “I want to congratulate UN Women for their fight in the elimination of violence against women but, most importantly, for their work in rehabilitating women in Africa. Africa has lost a lot and we need to rehabilitate it. Our maternal values and the values of the African women is not being shown. The African identity is to respect women.”

https://allafrica.com/stories/202411260018.html,Africa: Confronting South Africa's Crisis of Gender-Based Violence,"press release

Government Needs to Intensify Efforts to End the Violence

Gender-based violence (GBV) remains shockingly pervasive across South Africa, according to a new report. Despite the country's robust legal framework and policies aimed at tackling GBV, the practice is deeply rooted in societal norms and incidents continue to escalate at an alarming rate.

On November 18, South Africa's Human Sciences Research Council released its first national study on GBV prevalence in the country. The study highlights, among other things, societal attitudes towards gender power dynamics; the prevalence and patterns of GBV experiences among women and the perpetration of violence by men; and presents data underscoring the GBV crisis.

According to the researchers, ""the data reveals deeply ingrained gender norms and power dynamics, with strong cultural reinforcement of traditional gender roles and a troubling acceptance of male aggression and dominance.""

The study surveyed a sample of households in 1,000 communities across South Africa's nine provinces. About 10,000 people, men and women, participated in the survey. Of the women surveyed, more than 1 in 3, 36 percent, said they experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives, while 24 percent reported experiencing violence by an intimate partner.

The study also uncovered disturbing opinions held by men regarding gender roles. Nearly 70 percent said a wife should obey her husband, and 15 percent felt a husband had the right to ""punish"" his wife for wrongdoings. Almost 23 percent believed a wife may not refuse to have sex with her husband. Nearly 10 percent held the false idea that women are often to blame if they were raped, and 12 percent wrongly believe if a woman does not physically resist it is not rape.

Furthermore, the study highlighted the longstanding issue of violence against women with disabilities, which previously lacked much data. According to responses, 31 percent of women with disabilities have experienced sexual or physical violence in their lifetime.

While often perpetrated behind closed doors GBV is not a private matter, but a serious public crime that denies women and girls the most fundamental of human rights including the rights to be free from violence, discrimination, and to physical integrity. Failure to take effective steps to deter and punish it, is a human rights violation.

The South African government needs to increase its efforts to combat all forms of GBV. This should include implementing the report's recommendations for holistic approaches to individual, interpersonal, community, and societal-level interventions, and strengthening availability of and access to psychosocial services for GBV survivors. The government should also promptly establish a coordinating body to address GBV as required under the 2024 National Council on GBV and Femicide Act, and ensure full implementation of the 2020 National Strategic Plan on GBV and Femicide.

South African women cannot afford to wait any longer for the comprehensive changes needed to end the country's shocking rates of gender-based violence.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2021/09/being-silent-is-no-longer-an-option-traditional-leaders-of-africa,"Being silent is no longer an option: traditional leaders of Africa intensify their efforts to end child marriage, female genital mutilation and other harmful practices","Traditional leaders of Africa confirm their commitment in joining hands with UN Women and taking bold action to end child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM) and other harmful practices. They aim to reach new members and communities to join the movement as champions for gender equality and positive masculinity.

Across the continent of Africa, traditional leaders, including religious leaders, continue to play significant roles as influencers and custodians of cultural practices within communities. As attention grows to the slow progress on ending gender-based violence, including child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), traditional leaders have a critical role in shifting the deep-rooted cultural beliefs that justify the perpetuation of these harmful practices.

At least one in three young women in Africa are married before they turn 18. Although there are signs of small progress in changing attitudes toward FGM, the practice remains a major problem across many countries on the continent. About 200 million girls and women have been subjected to the practice. Evidence shows that that these practices are caused by deep rooted inequality between men and women, patriarchal beliefs and harmful social norms, poverty and lack of education and awareness.

UN Women believes that investing in preventing these practices and other forms of violence against women and girls is a critical investment for upholding the rights of women and girls. UN Women has partnered with traditional leaders, including cultural and religious authorities, who are using their influence, knowledge, and power to put an end to child marriage and FGM in their communities.

Following a series of dialogue sessions facilitated by UN Women with over 300 traditional leaders from various countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, the Council of Traditional Leaders of Africa (COTLA) was established in February 2019. As a network of leaders, COTLA aims to drive the transformation and eradication of negative cultural practices, customs and traditions to end child marriage, FGM and other harmful practices. This year, the COTLA Steering Committee held its annual meeting in Kenya to outline actions to take forward the movement for the future.

“COTLA has the power to call out the patriarchy embedded in cultural practices, customs and traditions that perpetuate gender inequality and discrimination,” said Zebib Kavuma, UN Women East and Southern Africa Deputy Regional Director, opening the meeting. She also added “The COTLA journey tells the story of the transformative role of progressive traditional leaders, making gender equality a reality for future generations of young people in Africa to inherit.”

King Adedapo Aderemi of Nigeria, Convenor General of COTLA, is one of the most powerful allies of UN Women on this journey. “When we cooperate, we operate. We need to plan and walk the plan to end harmful practices in Africa. We are here to support UN Women because we believe in the cause,” he said.

This year’s meeting aimed at reviewing COTLA’s strategic approach and develop a workplan with key results that respond to the network’s commitments, accountability, and reporting mechanisms.

The meeting provided a range of opportunities for traditional leaders to exchange strategies they are using and discuss challenges for guiding how the network will achieve its ambitious vision for change. The gathering also created space to celebrate achievements. Through partnerships such as the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, traditional leaders are engaging with UN Women and other partners as agents of change. In Malawi, chiefs working with police, mother groups and child protection workers dissolved 1,893 child marriages. In Mozambique, traditional leaders agreed on an action plan at a national forum to address child marriage and gender-based violence in their communities. In Liberia, traditional chiefs in the 11 FGM practicing counties signed a Seven County Policy banning FGM. In Zimbabwe, the collaboration of traditional leaders supported a change in the use of cattle from an asset used as part of the bride price into a sanction that is imposed as a penalty for breaking the law when a child marriage takes place.

“In Zimbabwe, we are also championing education for girls. We should be taking a step-by-step approach … a girl child should be educated, a girl child should get qualifications, work and only then … marriage. I lobbied this with traditional leaders, and then shared this vision touring small villages,” said Senator Nkatazo Siatabwa, Chief Siansali of Zimbabwe.

Hosted by UN Women, the four-day meeting also provided a platform for traditional leaders to voice their Generation Equality commitments. “As a Council of Traditional Leaders of Africa, we commit to support governments across Africa to protect the rights of the girl child emphasizing investments in sexual and reproductive health, and by ensuring that menstrual hygiene of young girls is prioritized and accessible by 2030,” said Queen Martha Sekhothali Mabena of South Africa, who champions for sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender equality in South Africa.

Other Generation Equality commitments included intensifying advocacy initiatives and policy dialogue to accelerate the end of child marriage and female genital mutilation by 2030; conducting a gender-responsive review of customary laws that address access to justice for victims/survivors and punishments for perpetrators by 2023; promoting positive masculinity to embody and act as role models in their communities and families and engage at least 80 per cent of men in communities as allies for gender equality and women’s empowerment.

“Evidence shows that violence against women is preventable. Traditional leaders can be key partners in preventing child marriage and eliminating FGM, among other harmful practices by calling out violence, standing in support with survivors and advocating for change,” said Sunita Caminha, UN Women Regional EVAW Advisor for East and Southern Africa, commending COTLA for committing to use their power for transformative change.

At the end of the meeting, traditional leaders adopted a communique and agreed to reach new members and communities on their journey to promote gender equality and positive masculinity across Africa.

https://allafrica.com/stories/201906030802.html,Africa: Gender Inequality is Dangerous to Our Health – And it is Time We Address it,"guest column

Unbiased health systems are necessary for effective and efficient health care delivery. Their strength is fundamental to achieving universal health coverage, a target of the SDGs shared by 193 nations.

Unfortunately, a new Lancet Series on Gender Equality, Health, and Norms finds that health systems reflect and reinforce the gender biases and restrictive gender norms in society, and these biases and norms undermine the work of health systems and compromise the safety and well-being of providers – and the overall health of people and communities.

Restrictive gender norms – defined as social roles that are considered appropriate for people based on their actual or perceived sex – are reinforced in the system when health services prioritise care in ways consistent with traditional norms. This results in poor care for women, men and gender minorities, in ways that include valuing women based on their reproductive capacity and care provision for children; viewing men as strong, and thus, not in need of care; and defining both men and women strictly as heterosexual and cisgender. Men are often excluded from maternal and child health care, despite evidence of the importance of their inclusion – and research shows clinical resistance to men's engagement in maternal and paediatric care, which reinforces restrictive, factually incorrect norms that men are not needed for maternal and child health.

Gender inequalities also manifest in the health care workforce, where men hold greater authority as health professionals, relative to women. The paradigm ""men cure, women care"" highlights the overwork, devaluation and abuse of women health care providers. Globally, women remain least represented at the top of the medical hierarchy among ministers and physicians, and are most represented at the bottom as nurses, nurse midwives and community health workers (CHWs). While CHWs play an integral role in supporting the health system's reach and impact for socially marginalised groups, typically in their own communities, these positions continue to range from low-paid, to incentivised, to unpaid. Challenges of overwork and abuse manifest in work stress, job dissatisfaction, and burnout, resulting in poorer quality of care and even abuse of patients and poorer patient outcomes.

Yet the Series also finds that health systems can change. Health systems can be disrupted using gender transformative approaches operating outside health systems, through social and economic policies supportive of gender equality; within health systems, via support, value and safety for workers; and with health systems, through social and community accountability – to alter restrictive gender norms and reduce gender inequalities. Gender transformative approaches can help address gender inequalities within health systems by including increasing representation of women physicians to improve better health outcomes; acknowledging that gender parity alone does not mean equal treatment, pay or opportunity; increasing community respect and support of frontline workers to improve productivity and impact; and improving institutional support and respect for nurses to improve quality of care.

Finally, those working to change health systems should align and ally with social movements, community activism and collective efforts for change and accountability. Women's movements and social movements that target gender roles have gained traction, bringing gendered health policy improvements, as with the expansion of reproductive rights in Ireland and the strengthening of the criminal justice system's response to rape in India. Community organising and self-help groups can increase health care access and improve health provider responsiveness as evidenced by the transformative work in the National Rural Livelihood Mission as well as work with self-help groups in Bihar, India.

This evidence suggests that we need to go beyond seeing gender equality as an 'add on' – and instead see it as a fundamental factor that predetermines and shapes health systems and outcomes. We need to rethink our models, which at their core reflect our collective aspirations of what health systems are meant to deliver. We need to make our aspirations around gender equality explicit – from policy, to administration, to service provision – and evaluate and assess progress against these values. Drawing from research in this Series, and building on prior work, we put forward a set of aspirations for gender equitable health systems, that:

1. Reflect and reinforce a gender equitable society;

2. Address gender norms and root causes of inequalities, across the life course;

3. Provide equal opportunity for healthcare professionals of all genders to enter, thrive, and advance within health systems;

4. Ensure equal access and usage of high-quality health services by people of all genders, unimpeded by financial, social and geographic barriers; and

5. Commit to being held accountable to address gender inequalities at all levels.

We must take steps immediately — at the societal and political level — to transform the way gender is reflected in our health systems. Health systems must be held accountable to address gender inequalities and restrictive gender norms. Given the persistence of restrictive gender norms within systems – even with progressive policies and programs – innovative approaches are needed. The global health community needs to see themselves as an integral part of this broader social reform.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/press-release/2022/02/promoting-positive-masculinities-for-centering-an-inclusive-covid-19-recovery,Promoting Positive Masculinities for Centering an Inclusive COVID-19 Recovery,"UN Women and UNFPA regional offices in East and Southern Africa are collaborating toward growing a movement for positive masculinity and meaningful engagement of men and boys in advancing gender equality and women’s rights.

Kigali, 28 February 2022 - Promoting positive forms of masculinity is a key element of the joint efforts of two United Nations agencies to achieve gender equality and end the shadow pandemic of violence against women and girls that has surged alongside the COVID-19 pandemic.

By challenging restrictive ideas about what it means to be a man—new spaces and opportunities are created for diverse women, men, girls and boys to engage and contribute to sustainable development and charting pathways for recovery from COVID-19. Shifting harmful social norms driving gender inequality and violence against women must be at the forefront of the efforts by all actors and institutions, and there is promising work underway from regional to local levels that has brought progress and can pave the way forward if better connected.

These were some of the key takeaways shared by participants at a critical dialogue convened today by UN Women and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in East and Southern Africa on the sidelines of the Eighth Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. The virtual side event highlighted the efforts and progress to promote positive masculinities in support of a green, inclusive, and resilient recovery across the continent.

Through the joint virtual dialogue, UN Women and UNFPA brought together key actors from the African Union Commission, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as civil society - including the African Population and Health Research Center, the Malawi Interfaith AIDS Alliance, Raising Voices from Uganda and the Rwanda Men’s Network, to showcase promising practices and opportunities in promoting more progressive forms of masculinity at individual, interpersonal institutional and societal levels. The virtual discussion drew key recommendations that can be taken forward by the Outcome Document of the Forum and showcase opportunities for accelerating progress across Africa and beyond.

Lack of inclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the visibility of gender-based inequalities and exacerbated women and girls’ experiences of gender-based violence in its various forms, pulling back critical progress made on the SDGs. Patriarchy, toxic masculinities and harmful social norms are at the core of these inequalities, which are visible in all spaces and structures within society. The lack of inclusion of diverse women and men in leadership and decision-making processes related to the COVID-19 response has limited the impact and sustainability of solutions identified for pandemic recovery and deepened pre-pandemic inequalities.

In her opening remarks, UNFPA Deputy Regional Director, Beatrice Mutali said that ‘Evidence shows men and boys are the main perpetrators of VAWG – it is critical to engage them meaningfully, promoting gender-equitable norms, behaviours and attitudes starting at a very young age. What we see and what we hear shape us.’

The dialogue shed light on the importance of positive masculinity in addressing the interconnected issues of environmental justice and gender equality toward achievement of the SDG5 and by extension, all SDGs. The panelists shared their expert reflections on policy and programmatic actions to accelerate innovative models for transforming norms, approaches and strategies on positive masculinity, and highlighted African Union member states’ commitments to foster positive masculinity in the context of the SDGs and Africa Agenda 2063.

In her closing remarks, Adekemi Ndieli, Representative a.i. for UN Women Uganda said, “Today's discussion reaffirmed the need to promote positive masculinities to unlock the much-needed progress for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across Africa and also to build back better. These efforts must look beyond individual expressions of masculinities and work to transform the way masculinities maintain unequal structures of power within institutions and across society.”

The dialogue highlighted the potential of the movement for positive masculinity, and it reaffirmed the commitments made at the African Union 2021 Men’s Conference on Positive Masculinity, as well as progress made following the Men Engage Alliance’s Ubuntu Symposium. This will ensure the momentum towards the High-Level Political Forum 2022 for collective accountability of all actors and institutions in shaping more equitable norms and strengthened partnerships and solidarity with women’s and feminist movements in promoting positive masculinities and a more sustainable, green and equitable future for all.

The summary report for the dialogue is available here.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/02/care-services-and-social-care-infrastructure,Care Services and Social Care Infrastructure,"Unpaid care works takes up more time in the lives of women’s and girls’ compared to men and boys (UN-Women, 2019). This is mainly due to gender roles, stereotypes, and to a bigger extent, cultural gender norms and values. While women spend time doing the difficult work of attending to others' care needs for free, research shows that men rarely do so and are instead heavily invested in paid work on any given day (UN Women, 2022).

Unpaid caregiving is one of the leading causes of time poverty for women, according to a recent study performed in Rwanda by Oxfam in collaboration with the University of Rwanda. The findings revealed that women dedicate three hours to household duties, essentially unpaid care work, for every hour males do (UN Women, 2022). This means that high levels of poverty and a lack of public services make life more difficult for women and girls, as well as their families, making women more exposed to exhaustion.

It is in that framework that this survey identified the needs and barriers faced by rural and urban women regarding unpaid care work, identifying existing care services and social care infrastructures in 8 Districts of Rwanda targeted by UN Women, and assess their availability and functionality in addressing the needs faced by men and women affected by the burden of unequal unpaid care work.",unpaid care works takes time lives womens girls compared men boys unwomen mainly due gender roles stereotypes bigger extent cultural gender norms values while women spend time doing difficult work attending others care needs free research shows men rarely do instead heavily invested paid work any given day un women unpaid caregiving one leading causes time poverty women according recent study performed rwanda oxfam collaboration university rwanda findings revealed women dedicate three hours household duties essentially unpaid care work every hour males do un women means high levels poverty lack public services make life difficult women girls well families making women exposed exhaustion framework survey identified needs barriers faced rural urban women regarding unpaid care work identifying existing care services social care infrastructures districts rwanda targeted un women assess availability functionality addressing needs faced men women affected burden unequal unpaid care work
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2021/03/ten-african-women-leaders-we-admire,Ten African Women leaders we admire,"Partly drawn from global website article Women leaders we admire dated: Wednesday, March 10, 2021

Women leaders of today are tenacious and diverse. They are mobilizing the global climate movement, pushing for social protections, addressing the COVID-19 crisis, and dismantling systemic racial discrimination. Across the continent, women leaders improve lives and inspire a better future for all.

Yet, equality is still far off, and progress on women’s participation in decision-making is too slow. Too many people still believe men make natural and better leaders than women, too many institutions are set up to favour and propel men’s leadership, and funding for women’s campaigns and initiatives remain pitifully low. At the current rate of progress, it will take 130 years to reach gender equality in the highest positions of power.

To change course, power must be shared equally, made visible and accountable, at all levels, and that is what’s at the core of feminist leadership.

Leading with feminist principles means redefining value and success, sharing power and credit, building community and relationships, and, ultimately, tackling the roots of oppressive structures and social norms that hold back progress for all people, including women and girls.

We need transformative feminist leadership to face the unprecedented challenges of our times. Here are just 10 African women leaders among many, many others, who inspire us, and this is what they have to say about feminist leadership.

Damilola Odufuwa and Odunayo Eweniyi

Damilola Odufuwa and Odunayo Eweniyi are successful entrepreneurs and young feminist leaders from Nigeria. Recently, both were named in the Bloomberg 50 list of people who changed global business in 2020 and the TIME Next 100 list in February 2021.

Odufuwa and Eweniyi joined forces in 2020 to create the Feminist Coalition, which focuses on women’s rights and safety, economic empowerment, and political participation of women in Nigeria. For its first project, the organisation supported the #EndSARS protests that swept Nigeria in 2020 and organized a food drive for low-income women and their families.

“A feminist leader will recognize that all women and all men deserve equal opportunities to pursue fulfilling careers and lives, and put structures in place to help others live up to their potential and drive meaningful change,” says Eweniyi. “A feminist leader is empathetic and understands the importance of intersectionality,” adds Odufuwa.

What can leaders do to lead with feminist principles? Odufuwa says, “employ more women into leadership roles and pay women fairly; be willing to unlearn biases and listen to constructive feedback - then effect change; and be conscious of intersectionality.”

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

As Africa’s first democratically-elected woman president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf led Liberia through reconciliation and recovery following a decade-long civil war and responded to the Ebola Crisis of 2014-2015. She has won international acclaim for the economic, social, and political achievements of her administration, and, in 2011, she was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for her work to empower women.

Today, Sirleaf is an influential voice for expanding women’s political participation and involvement in decision-making processes. “Increasingly there is recognition that full gender equity will ensure a stronger economy, a more developed nation, a more peaceful nation. And that is why we must continue to work,” she says.

Emtithal Mahmoud

Emtithal Mahmoud is a world champion slam poet and activist for the refugee cause. Born in Khartoum, Sudan, “Emi” – as she is known among her supporters– immigrated to the United States of America as a child with her family. She uses her talents to shine a light on the experiences of millions of refugees worldwide.

“I use my words to raise the alarm on the conflicts of our time...in the hopes that someone might hear something that moves them,” says Emi. In 2016, she was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador and has visited refugee camps in Jordan, Uganda, and Greece, teaching poetry workshops and inspiring countless refugees to share their story.

Meaza Ashenafi

Meaza Ashenafi is the first female Chief Justice of Ethiopia and a trailblazer in many ways, mainly for legal advocacy through her work with Ethiopian Women’s Lawyers Association (EWLA), an organization she co-founded with like-minded young female lawyers. After finishing law school from Addis Ababa University, of which she was the only female graduate from her class year, she served as a criminal court judge, which allowed her to see first-hand how the laws were discriminating against women.

“When we founded EWLA 20 years ago, we did historic work of getting discriminatory laws, such as family law, citizenship law, pension law repealed. We brought the word ‘Sexual Abuse’ and ‘Sexual Harassment’ into the Amharic Language, as there were no words to describe them then”.

Chief Justice Meaza is also a co-founder along with other female businesswomen of Enat Bank, the first bank in Ethiopia founded by a female-majority shareholders, which she co-founded after noticing there was lack of financial provision for women.

“Leadership for me is having a vision and striving to achieve it. Women need to believe that they can do whatever they set themselves to do, despite the society’s pressure and people telling them otherwise. You can only have the power to be a change maker if you believe in yourself,” she says.

Zoneziwoh Mbondgulo-Wondieh

Feminist blogger and humanitarian reporter from Cameroon, Zoneziwoh Mbondgulo-Wondieh is the founder of the NGO Women for a Change and a member of the civil society advisory group to the Generation Equality Forum.

In her work as an activist and as a reporter, Mbondgulo-Wondieh gives voice to Cameroonian women's perspectives on the country's development.

“We must not lose focus towards accelerating efforts like never before in increasing women’s voices, leadership and agency. The Generation Equality Forum provides us all … an opportunity to ensure that we be the first generation to be serious about realizing an equal future for all,” she said in her remarks at the United Nations commemoration of International Women’s Day 2021.

Glanis Changachirere

Glanis Changachirere, Zimbabwean women’s rights activist, is the founding Director of the Institute for Young Women Development (IYWD) and the founding Coordinator of the African Women Leaders Forum. She is also a member of the Steering Committee of the Zimbabwean chapter of the UN Women-supported African Women Leaders Network.

Raised in the deeply patriarchal, rural province of Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe, Changachirere explains that it was the pain she experienced trying to assert that girls were equal to boys and deserved equal education and career opportunities that motivated her to start IYDW at the age of 26: “As young women, we need to redefine ourselves, both to ourselves and also to the society they need to see a young women in a different way altogether,” she says.

In 2013, Changachirere received the 30 Under 30 Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy in recognition of her pioneering work on young women’s political participation. Today, IYWD is a movement of 7,000 young women members across rural and mining communities in the country. At the national level, IYWD is working with the Zimbabwe Gender Commission to introduce a Gender Equality Bill to challenge the cultural inequalities and injustices borne by young women in the country.

Farida Charity

Farida Charity, 36 years old, is a community leader and peace advocate supporting peace initiatives in the conflict-affected district of Yumbe, Northern Uganda.

Charity started her activism at a very young age, when she participated in the peace negotiations with the Uganda National Rescue Front which led to a formal ceasefire agreement between the rebels and the government in 2002.

Today, Charity is the speaker of the Yumbe District Council. For five years, she has been using her leadership position to advocate for policies that promote the peaceful co-existence between the refugee and host communities in the district, and to advocate for health services for women and girls. As the chairperson of the Council’s Women Caucus, Charity mobilized fellow women leaders to start mentoring programmes targeted at school-age girls from host and refugee communities, focused on preventing sexual gender-based violence, managing conflict and keeping girls in school.

“The things that women need sound simple but they are big issues especially in rural communities. Women need peace and access to health care services. The most important thing is to have peace, and to look at ourselves as human beings, regardless of gender, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds,” Charity says.

Munnira Katongole

Munnira Katongole is a young South African activist fighting for social change and climate justice. She is part of Youth @ SAIIA, the youth development and programming initiative of the South African Institute of International Affairs.

She views climate change as a wake-up call to transform systems of exploitation that maintain discrimination against young women of colour.

Her call: clean energy, sustainable food, collective ownership.

""We can’t, especially now in the face of climate change, be excluded from policy-making settings... To all the young girls of colour reading this... you have every right to take up space. Occupy, fill and cement – unapologetically,"" Katongole says.

Alice Banze

Alice Banze, born and raised in Maputo, Mozambique, is a trained social scientist with a 25-year career in civil society organizations (Oxfam, Gender Links) and government. She is the Executive Director of Gender and Sustainable Development Association and a member of the UN Women-supported African Women Leaders Network. In December 2020, Banze was elected member of the National Elections Commission with the support of the Women's Forum, an umbrella grouping of Mozambican women’s rights organizations.

The fact that the Commission is composed of only three women out of 17 should not constitute a reason for alarm, Banze explains: “Things are changing. Similar to the changes in the government, in parliament, in the judicial system and other areas of public life, the Commission will also have a fair representation of women soon.”

Banze dedicated most of her career to training women into leadership positions, and she will not stop until women in Mozambique will have equal representation: “More women in public life is critical because women play such an important role in the development of a country. Besides, there are protocols, treaties, conventions signed by the government to ensure there is 50 per cent representation of women in all decision-making processes at all levels. This commitment must be fulfilled,” Banze says.",partly drawn global website article women leaders admire dated wednesday march women leaders today tenacious diverse mobilizing global climate movement

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2015/08/un-w-executive-dir-calls-for-hastening-of-achievement-of-ge-and-women-s-empowerment,UN Women’s Executive Director calls for hastening of achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment,"Johannesburg, South Africa - The Under Secretary General and UN Women Executive Director, Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka has called for the hastening of gender equality and women’s empowerment in the world.

During her recent visit to South Africa to mark the Women’s month in South Africa, the ED said that although a review on the progress made since the historic conference 20 years ago in Beijing showed that countries around the world had enacted more and better laws promising gender equality, the hard truth is that no country in the world has achieved gender equality.

She observed that despite advances that have been made, the Beijing+20 reviews have found that there are clear gaps between the laws and their actual implementation.

“For example, although South African law prohibits sex-based discrimination, we know that women here continue to experience bias and inequality in all aspects of life and at all ages. This glaring gap between policy and practice is not unique to South Africa. Around the world, we have seen that discriminatory social norms, gender stereotypes and unequal power relations between women and men have been too slow to change,” she said.

Dr. Mlambo-Ngcuka stressed the need to seize all opportunities at national, regional and global levels to ensure that gender is mainstreamed across all policy areas and implemented at all levels.

During her ten day visit to South Africa, the ED attended various events and all of these she called on more action towards ensuring gender equality.

The ED attended the Africa Regional Conference of the South African Chapter of the International Association of Women Judges (SAC-IAWJ) where she gave a keynote address “Beyond Words, beyond 2015: embracing the discourse of legal implementation to realize Planet 50-50.”

She underscored the pivotal role that the judiciary has in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 16 which calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provision of access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institu-tions at all levels.

The ED, however noted that the role of the judiciary went beyond SDG 16 as they had the critical responsibility of driving the successful implementation of the new development agenda in its totality by ensuring that the law is enforced in the implementation.

Towards gender equality, the ED said that the judiciary can help to ensure that all discriminatory laws against women are eliminated, including family laws, penal codes, nationality laws, and laws relating to inheritance, ownership and control over land and other resources.

The ED also attended a Brunswick Women’s break-fast to mark the South Africa Women’s Day and gave a key note address on “The role of private sector in ending gender inequality in this generation”. Brunswick, founded in 1987, is an advisory firm specializing in critical issues and corporate relations: a global partnership with 23 offices in 14 countries.

Dr Mlambo-Ngcuka stressed those sustainable results for women’s economic empowerment can only be achieved by creating enabling environments, including in the Private Sector, which promote women’s full economic participation and secure their rightful position in society as agents of change.

And at a UN Women’s National Flagship Event to celebrate Beijing+20, the SDGs and South Africa’s Women’s Month, the ED identified South Africa’s major achievements as:

the alignment of the country’s legislative framework with international human rights standards;

the progressive expansion of women’s role in politics and in decision-making positions both in the public and the private sectors; and

the enacting of institutional mechanisms that promote women’s human rights. However, despite these advances, the Beijing+20 review of South Africa found clear gaps between the laws and their actual implementation

The ED ended her mission by attending the Closing event of the Building Bridges Project which is a youth’s organization focused on putting youth at the center of the post-2015 development agenda. In this respect, Jilt van Schayik and Teun Meulepas the Founders of Building Bridges cycled from Amsterdam to Cape Town across 20 Countries holding consultations with young people where possible.

Dr. Mlambo-Ngcuka disclosed that UN Women is now in the process of drafting a new strategy on Youth to strengthen initiatives for the empowerment of young women and to develop young men as partners in gender equality and women’s rights.

“With half of the world’s population today being under the age of 30, and with the projection that this number will rise to 75 per cent by 2025, young people have a critical role to play in achieving transformative change,” she said.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2019/05/cost-of-gender-gap-2019,The Cost of the Gender Gap in Agriculture,"Gender gaps in agricultural productivity have arisen not because women are less efficient farmers, but because women experience inequitable access to land and to agricultural inputs. Such unbalanced distribution frequently stems from and is bolstered by deeply entrenched sociocultural norms and traditional expectations of gender roles. This structure of constraints is multifaceted. For example, women are more income- and time-constrained than men, which has repercussions on their ability to access credit, land and appropriate levels of inputs. These constraints thus lead to sizeable gender gaps in the adoption of high-value crops and in the use of agricultural implements, male family labour, pesticides and fertilizer, among other elements. Furthermore, agricultural productivity has been challenged by its high dependency on rainfall, ongoing environmental hazards and the effects of climate change, which cumulatively affect the productivity of both men and women farmers. However, gender gaps in agriculture result from how women and men differently access, participate in, adopt and benefit from climate-smart agriculture.",gender gaps agricultural productivity have arisen because women less efficient farmers because women experience inequitable access land agricultural inputs unbalanced distribution frequently stems bolstered deeply entrenched sociocultural norms traditional expectations gender roles structure constraints multifaceted example women income timeconstrained men which has repercussions ability access credit land appropriate levels inputs constraints thus lead sizeable gender gaps adoption highvalue crops use agricultural implements male family labour pesticides fertilizer among other elements furthermore agricultural productivity has challenged high dependency rainfall ongoing environmental hazards effects climate change which cumulatively affect productivity both men women farmers however gender gaps agriculture result how women men differently access participate adopt benefit climatesmart agriculture

UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls, UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide.

UN Women supports UN Member States as they set global standards for achieving gender equality, and works with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. It works globally to make the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals a reality for women and girls and stands behind women’s equal participation in all aspects of life, focusing on four strategic priorities:

UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN system’s work in advancing gender equality, and in all deliberations and agreements linked to the 2030 Agenda. The entity works to position gender equality as fundamental to the Sustainable Development Goals, and a more inclusive world.

Status of women

Gender equality is not only a basic human right, but its achievement has enormous socio-economic ramifications. Empowering women fuels thriving economies, spurring productivity and growth. Yet gender inequalities remain deeply entrenched in every society. Women lack access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender wage gaps. They are too often denied access to basic education and health care. Women in all parts of the world suffer violence and discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic decision-making processes.

Over many decades, the United Nations has made significant progress in advancing gender equality, including through landmark agreements such as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Working for the empowerment and rights of women and girls globally, UN Women’s main roles are:

Historical perspective

For many years, the United Nations faced serious challenges in its efforts to promote gender equality globally, including inadequate funding and no single recognized driver to direct UN activities on gender equality issues. In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, to address such challenges. In doing so, UN Member States took an historic step in accelerating the Organization’s goals on gender equality and the empowerment of women. The creation of UN Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system, which focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s empowerment:",work priorities un women united nations entity dedicated gender equality empowerment women global champion women girls un women established accelerate progress meeting needs worldwide un women supports un member states set global standards achieving gender equality works governments civil society design laws policies programmes services needed ensure standards effectively implemented truly benefit women girls worldwide works globally make vision sustainable development goals reality women girls stands behind womens equal participation all aspects life focusing four strategic priorities un women also coordinates promotes un systems work advancing gender equality all deliberations agreements linked agenda entity works position gender equality fundamental sustainable development goals inclusive world status women gender equality basic human right achievement has enormous socioeconomic ramifications empowering women fuels thriving economies spurring productivity growth yet gender inequalities remain deeply entrenched every society women lack access decent work face occupational segregation gender wage gaps too often denied access basic education health care women all parts world suffer violence discrimination underrepresented political economic decisionmaking processes many decades united nations has made significant progress advancing gender equality including through landmark agreements beijing declaration platform action convention elimination all forms discrimination against women cedaw working empowerment rights women girls globally un womens main roles historical perspective many years united nations faced serious challenges efforts promote gender equality globally including inadequate funding single recognized driver direct un activities gender equality issues july united nations general assembly created un women united nations entity gender equality empowerment women address challenges doing un member states took historic step accelerating organizations goals gender equality empowerment women creation un women came part un reform agenda bringing together resources mandates greater impact merges builds important work four previously distinct parts un system which focused exclusively gender equality womens empowerment
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2020/02/unstereotype-alliance-launched-in-sa,UN Women launches South Africa Chapter of the Unstereotype Alliance,"UN Women South Africa Multi-Country Office launched the South African National Chapter of the Unstereotype Alliance in Johannesburg on 11 February 2020.

The Unstereotype Alliance, a thought and action platform, seeks to eradicate harmful gender-based stereotypes in all media and advertising content. Convened by UN Women, the Unstereotype Alliance contributes to empowering women in all their diversity and addressing harmful masculinities to help create a gender equal world.

At the 2019 Loeries Creative Awards for Africa and Middle East, UN Women South Africa announced the creation of the Unstereotype Alliance (UA) South African Chapter in collaboration with founding ally members the Loeries and the Marketing Association of South Africa both leading organizations with an important voice in South Africa’s marketing and advertising industry. Facebook and Google were also named as the first corporate members to join. Since the announcement, the Alliance has gained Unilever and Ster-Kinekor as additional founding members.

Over the past two years, the Unstereotype Alliance has built momentum behind notable achievements such as, including “unstereotyped” judging criteria as part of the Cannes Lions jury criterion and expanding its footprint through affiliate national chapters in Brazil, Turkey and now South Africa.

The Alliance has commissioned original research and developed best practice playbooks and measurement tools to help marketers and agency teams create more progressive unstereotyped communications. In addition, it created a global open-sourced single measurement tool to help discriminate between progressive and regressive gender portrayals of characters in advertising.

The launch was used as an opportunity to showcase the impact of unstereotyped advertising; to discuss how corporates and the creative industry can use their massive advertising power and influence for good and towards creating a more gender equal society; and to call for more companies, advertising agencies and creative enterprises to formally join the Unstereotype Alliance.

Speaking at the launch, UN Women South Africa Multi-Country Office Representative, Anne Githuku-Shongwe said, “Toxic gender stereotypes can be unstereotyped if every advert and every marketing campaign portrays the power of women and redefines masculinity.”

As convener, UN Women will be looking to include more influential brands to join the Alliance and lead the creative industry in addressing the unconscious bias against women and girls.

Facebook Africa Country Director, Nunu Ntshingila said her organization was “extremely excited to join the alliance and contribute to an unstereotyped world”. While Google South Africa Head of Marketing, Asha Patel, who called on corporates and advertisers to take responsibility for the content put out to consumers which either promotes or stifles gender equality, “We have to hold ourselves accountable”, she remarked.

The Alliance also recognises the power of partnerships to accelerate progress - the initiative is industry-led and calls on businesses to become champions of addressing gender bias in the creative and consumer industries. Unilever Consumer and Market Insights Director Stacey Grant was optimistic that the Alliance would use their collective influence to bring about much-needed change. “There is power

in collaboration and the Unstereotype Alliance South Africa National Chapter should be supported to achieve its goals,” she said.

Importantly, the national Chapter will thrive on the fact that South African advertisers have already been tackling the issues of stereotypes and realise their role in leading change in society.

Marketing Association of South Africa CEO Sechaba Motsieloa called for action on unstereotyping to be elevated in corporate structures. “We need to begin to have conversations at C-Suite level with marketing companies to eradicate harmful gender-based stereotypes”. Incoming Loeries CEO Preetesh Sewraj agreed stating that creative work must always have an unstereotyped approach. “The challenge is to ensure that we are doing things differently that provoke change.”",un women south africa multicountry office launched south african national chapter unstereotype alliance johannesburg february unstereotype alliance thought action platform seeks eradicate harmful genderbased stereotypes all media advertising content convened un women unstereotype alliance contributes empowering women all diversity addressing harmful masculinities help create gender equal world loeries creative awards africa middle east un women south africa announced creation unstereotype alliance ua south african chapter collaboration founding ally members loeries marketing association south africa both leading organizations important voice south africas marketing advertising industry facebook google also named first corporate members join since announcement alliance has gained unilever sterkinekor additional founding members past two years unstereotype alliance has built momentum behind notable achievements including unstereotyped judging criteria part cannes lions jury criterion expanding footprint through affiliate national chapters brazil turkey south africa alliance has commissioned original research developed best practice playbooks measurement tools help marketers agency teams create progressive unstereotyped communications addition created global opensourced single measurement tool help discriminate between progressive regressive gender portrayals characters advertising launch used opportunity showcase impact unstereotyped advertising discuss how corporates creative industry use massive advertising power influence good towards creating gender equal society call companies advertising agencies creative enterprises formally join unstereotype alliance speaking launch un women south africa multicountry office representative anne githukushongwe said toxic gender stereotypes unstereotyped every advert every marketing campaign portrays power women redefines masculinity convener un women looking include influential brands join alliance lead creative industry addressing unconscious bias against women girls facebook africa country director nunu ntshingila said her organization extremely excited join alliance contribute unstereotyped world while google south africa head marketing asha patel who called corporates advertisers take responsibility content put consumers which either promotes stifles gender equality have hold ourselves accountable remarked alliance also recognises power partnerships accelerate progress initiative industryled calls businesses become champions addressing gender bias creative consumer industries unilever consumer market insights director stacey grant optimistic alliance would use collective influence bring muchneeded change there power collaboration unstereotype alliance south africa national chapter supported achieve goals said importantly national chapter thrive fact south african advertisers have already tackling issues stereotypes realise role leading change society marketing association south africa ceo sechaba motsieloa called action unstereotyping elevated corporate structures need begin have conversations csuite level marketing companies eradicate harmful genderbased stereotypes incoming loeries ceo preetesh sewraj agreed stating creative work must always have unstereotyped approach challenge ensure doing things differently provoke change
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2018/05/africa-reps-retreat-meeting,Africa Strategy Rolled up,"The senior management of UN Women Africa met in Kenya in May to discuss operationalization of the Africa Strategy which seeks to address gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls on the continent. This was the first time that all the UN Women country representatives and regional directors in Africa were meeting to have discussions and create a common approach towards finding solutions to the many problems facing women and girls on the continent.

“We are looking at big game changers, for women’s economic empowerment in Africa, particularly with agriculture as an in-road. Looking at climate resilient or climate smart agriculture. On Child Marriage, when we look at statutory laws in Africa, all of them state the age of consent as 18 however when you look at customary and religious laws they are as low as 10 or when a girl sees her first period. So, understanding and harmonization of the laws are very critical. We are optimistic that after four years we are going to see an end in child marriage. There is a lot happening in Trafficking of Persons that has not seen a gender angle. IOM works a lot in trafficking and forced migration but many of the studies are gender blind, UN Women wants to bring out the gender angle. The third issue is that of the Women’s Movement, we recognize the movement is very pertinent and instrumental to the creation of UN Women” Reiterated Izeduwa Derex-Briggs.

The discussions centered around ending child marriage and FGM, womens movements, and trafficking of persons and forced migration. In addition, intra-regional knowledge sharing to improve learning and strengthen programming- and collaboration; and increased clarity on the impact of the UN reforms and the policy on zero tolerance to sexual harassment among others were discussed.

“Human trafficking has the face of a woman because the person who pays the highest price in trafficking is the woman or the girl. While other sister agencies are dealing with trafficking very capably they are not bringing the gender dimension forcibly into the discussion and into the discourse. And this is where we’re coming in. What us three regions are working on is not only bringing a joint programme with the three regions but also with other agencies, namely the International Organisation for Migration and the UN Office for Drugs and Crime”, commented Mohamed Naciri, regional director for North Africa, when asked about the prevalent issue of human trafficking.

Emphasis was placed on the need to address gaps and overlaps at the regional level and endorse a phased approach to revamp the UN development system at the regional level.

‘It is crucial for us to contextualize and align the strategy to our national priorities and use it as an entry point for interagency programs to ensure implementation of the SDGs and the AU vision 2063’., commented Diana Ofwona, regional director WACARO.

The meeting deliberations steered towards promotion of women to leadership and political processes, policies and enactment of laws, cultural practices, gender norms and stereotypes that can help promote women and girls to reach their potential.

Efforts to address these including collaboration with opinion makers and shapers including traditional leaders, hence the conference of traditional leaders on ending harmful practices in partnership with UNICEF & UNFPA which is planned for June 2018. In addition, a meeting to be led by Queen Mother of Baganda to include customary leaders, in preparation for a bigger meeting in August at the African Union.

The ROAS is leading in trafficking and forceful migration of persons, looking at Peace and Security, conflict and receiving countries, as well as the demand for illegal labour that is driving the population the Arab states through North African countries.

WACARO is leading on Women’s movement and is therefore looking into Civil Society Advisory Groups (CSAGs) including the African Women Leadership Network, Women economic empowerment, violence against women, among other sub issues. Another crucial area of discussion was the role of the youth and how UN Women can better involve the youth in its programming. With the upcoming Africa Youth Conference planned in October, it is hoped that UN Women will create a platform through which the voices of the youth can be heard.

The use of technology for economic empowerment, working with non-traditional partners, private sectors and governments as platforms in which UN Women can actively get involved in to encourage women and girls to use technology to bring change to their communities.",senior management un women africa met kenya may discuss operationalization africa strategy which seeks address gender equality empowerment women girls continent first time all un women country representatives regional directors africa meeting have discussions create common approach towards finding solutions many problems facing women girls continent looking big game changers womens economic empowerment africa particularly agriculture inroad looking climate resilient climate smart agriculture child marriage when look statutory laws africa all state age consent however when look customary religious laws low when girl sees her first period understanding harmonization laws very critical optimistic four years going see end child marriage there lot happening trafficking persons has seen gender angle iom works lot trafficking forced migration many studies gender blind un women wants bring gender angle third issue womens movement recognize movement very pertinent instrumental creation un women reiterated izeduwa derexbriggs discussions centered around ending child marriage fgm womens movements trafficking persons forced migration addition intraregional knowledge sharing improve learning strengthen programming collaboration increased clarity impact un reforms policy zero tolerance sexual harassment among others discussed human trafficking has face woman because person who pays highest price trafficking woman girl while other sister agencies dealing trafficking very capably bringing gender dimension forcibly discussion discourse where coming what three regions working bringing joint programme three regions also other agencies namely international organisation migration un office drugs crime commented mohamed naciri regional director north africa when asked prevalent issue human trafficking emphasis placed need address gaps overlaps regional level endorse phased approach revamp un development system regional level crucial contextualize align strategy national priorities use entry point interagency programs ensure implementation sdgs au vision commented diana ofwona regional director wacaro meeting deliberations steered towards promotion women leadership political processes policies enactment laws cultural practices gender norms stereotypes help promote women girls reach potential efforts address including collaboration opinion makers shapers including traditional leaders hence conference traditional leaders ending harmful practices partnership unicef unfpa which planned june addition meeting led queen mother baganda include customary leaders preparation bigger meeting august african union roas leading trafficking forceful migration persons looking peace security conflict receiving countries well demand illegal labour driving population arab states through north african countries wacaro leading womens movement therefore looking civil society advisory groups csags including african women leadership network women economic empowerment violence against women among other sub issues another crucial area discussion role youth how un women better involve youth programming upcoming africa youth conference planned october hoped un women create platform through which voices youth heard use technology economic empowerment working nontraditional partners private sectors governments platforms which un women actively get involved encourage women girls use technology bring change communities

I was born and raised in Addis Ababa by a strong single mother in a family of three girls and one boy, hence knowing that a woman is as strong as a man. I went to a private girls’ school, and I never understood the difference, the patriarchy. At a younger age, I was known for asking the ‘why?’ including for people’s right being violated.

Raised among women who were strong, for me women’s strength is a norm not an exception. I don’t tolerate abuse and violence. I remember as a high school student; how it angered me the society’s acceptance as a norm the catcalling and harassment of girls when they walk home from school. I never understood why this was allowed, sometimes going as far as forcing girls into relationships without their consent. This annoyed me and I used to go beyond my space to defend my own and others’ rights. There were many abusive cases where I had to stand on the street and fight for or else refer the victims to the relevant authority for protection. This became my passion and led me to earn my bachelor’s degree in law at Addis Ababa University and my master’s degree in Gender, Globalization and Right in Ireland. After serving as a prosecutor for almost ten years, I became the Executive Directress at Network of Ethiopian Women Association (NEWA) during its establishment. Since then, I have been a strong voice and advocate for women’s advancement for twenty years now through establishing and sustaining collaboration among relevant stakeholders throughout the country.

Despite the various challenges I faced in my work life, including changes in the government system, I continue to believe what I do matters and that I have what it takes to make a difference. The most challenging time was in 2009 when I had to decide for NEWA to continue working for women’s rights during the government’s unfavorable legal framework that limited Civil Society Organization’s foreign funding source to 10% for those working on human rights, gender equality and related issues. Mine and my colleagues’ decision to remain as an institution that fights for women’s and girls’ rights meant NEWA would struggle with very limited resources. This was a challenging season that tested my resolve from several directions, but also a rewarding route. The Union of Ethiopian Women Charitable Associations we established as a coping mechanism during those days, now has more than 80 member organizations. Despite the challenges, we stood firm in our vision. Such unity and outcome inspire me to do more.

My mother, a mother of four and a teacher by profession is my role model. She got married when she was still in high school. She went back to school and completed her college education earning the highest grade while raising her kids and supporting siblings. I have a supportive husband and three sons. I consistently discuss with them what I do and why I do human right protection including women’s right. They are always by my side in this journey.

I believe that unlike the context where I was raised in, the younger generations today are better informed with more opportunities to explore and transform the lives of women and girls for the better. My advice to them is to engage in intergenerational linkage as I consider that it is only by working together across generations that we can achieve our common goals and make a difference.”

The Network of Ethiopian Women Association (NEWA) has been one of the key partners of UN Women Ethiopia since its establishment. Through UN Women’s support under different thematic programs, NEWA has implemented various activities in different sectors to promote women’s socio-economic and legal rights resulting on a significance progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment in the country.

On the road to achieve gender equality,"Today Rwanda stands out both in Africa and around the world for its efforts to achieve gender equality. As a key partner of the Government of Rwanda and the lead UN entity on gender equality, UN Women Rwanda shares its journey and contributions to the progress in Rwanda, which has involved strategic interventions to address both the key drivers of women’s vulnerability and gender inequality.

The documentation builds on a previous UN Women publication “Towards Gender Equality in Rwanda” (2012-2016) and captures the progress made from 2017 to 2021 across the different focus areas: Leadership and Political Participation, Women’s Economic Empowerment and Ending Violence Against Women. It also touches on cross-cutting issues such as Data and Statistics, HIV/AIDS and the response to the unfolding crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the last five years, UN Women has been striving to amplify women’s voices and choices by addressing structural and socio-economic barriers to gender equality in Rwanda. Our thrust has been addressing negative social norms and fostering attitude and behavioral change; increasing women’s participation in leadership positions especially at the local level and in the private sector, strengthening women’s economic autonomy, enhancing GEWE accountability and frameworks; and prevention and response to address GBV.

Malawi, a nation previously grappling with high HIV prevalence and entrenched gender inequalities, is rewriting its narrative through transformative interventions spearheaded by UN Women. Gender inequalities and harmful societal norms fuel Malawi's HIV epidemic, disproportionately affecting women and girls. With approximately 991,600 people living with HIV (2024 Spectrum/Naomi estimates), the epidemic intersects with gender-based violence (GBV), creating a complex web of vulnerabilities. Recognizing this, UN Women launched the Gender and HIV HeForShe project in 2019 to address these challenges through a holistic, gender-sensitive lens.

HeForShe: Men as Champions for Equality

The HeForShe initiative, a global solidarity movement for gender equality, was introduced in Malawi in 2015. It engages men and boys as allies in dismantling patriarchal norms and promoting positive masculinity. HeForShe leverages the power of male allyship to drive sustainable change by fostering awareness, advocacy, and action for attitude and behaviour change.

Key tools, such as the HeForShe Barbershop Toolbox, create safe spaces for dialogues, equipping men and boys to challenge stereotypes, advocate for gender equity, and take tangible actions in their communities. The Barbershop Toolbox, developed by the governments of Iceland and Suriname in collaboration with the UN Women National Committee of Iceland, provides a step-by-step guide for inspiring leadership and raising awareness about gender equality. In Malawi, it has been adapted to engage men and boys in addressing issues like gender-based violence, HIV and shared responsibilities. Using accessible community spaces like barbershops, taverns/bars and marketplaces, the initiative fosters open discussions and promotes positive change in homes, workplaces, and communities. This innovative approach has directly mobilized over 26,000 men and boys and indirectly engaged more than 166,000 as community change agents.

Community-Centric Solutions

HeForShe works in the grassroots through various strategies. The initiative engaged traditional and religious leaders across the country. These gatekeepers of cultural norms play a pivotal role in promoting gender-sensitive policies. Through this engagement 52 by-laws were developed to combat violence against women and girls. Male-focused discussions in natural meeting places, such as barbershops, taverns/bars, fishercamps and markets, were held. This fosters openness about HIV, GBV, and sexual health. “The mobile clinics are really bringing the much-needed GBV and family planning services to us on the ground. This has eased the burden of having to travel long distances to access services’’ says Chikondi Mulaula, project beneficiary. The HeForShe initiative is addressing GBV and HIV as interconnected issues, the HeForShe framework enhances access to HIV testing, treatment, and education, particularly for men and boys to foster positive health seeking behaviours.

A catalyst for progress

Through strategic initiatives, HeForShe has catalyzed significant progress:

Strengthened Health-Seeking Behavior: Men’s health-seeking behaviors have improved, contributing to Malawi’s UNAIDS targets. As of December 2023, 97% of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) had been diagnosed out of which 98% were initiated on life prolonging Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 95% of PLHIV on ART were virally supressed. (97:98:95 vs 95:95:95 targets). as outlined by the National Aids Commission (NAC). Community outreach programs have increased HIV testing rates and defaulter tracing.

Policy Advancements: The launch of the National Male Engagement Strategy on Gender Equality, GBV, SRHR and HIV (2023–2030) underscores Malawi’s commitment to gender equality and a robust HIV response . ‘’As a nation, we are proud of the strides we are making within the Gender and HIV space, however, its important not to drop the momentum as we aim to reach the furthest mile. It is important that we continue to support communities and let them lead in the final response’’ says Lusungu Jonazi from UN Women Malawi,

Voices of Change

The HeForShe initiatives grassroots networks amplify the voices of local change agents—traditional leaders, youth, and community groups—who challenge harmful norms and advocate for equality. These efforts have not only reduced cases of GBV but have also created resilient community justice systems capable of addressing violence effectively. ‘“ Currently violence against women and girls has reduced because of different groups for example, HeForShe (group) act when there is a report that a woman or a girl has been violated. So, I can say now VAWG has reduced compared with the past (years)” says Boston Kella, Chairperson, HeForShe Mangochi network.

Contributing to the overarching goal of promoting the full and equal participation of Ethiopian women in leadership and decision making at all levels as well as promote gender responsive governance; UN Women’s women in leadership and governance program seeks to address multifaceted barriers that hinder women including young women and women with disabilities to meaningfully involve in public and political life. Unequal power relations, gender norms and discriminatory behaviors and practices keep holding women back from participation in leadership and governance processes while the patriarchal nature of public institutions coupled with gender blind normative frameworks exasperate the challenge. UN Women works with democratic institutions, the legislative and executive branch of the government including the gender machinery at federal and regional level as well as with CSOs and academia to alleviate these roadblocks to close the gender gap in public life. UN Women also works to increase the voice and agency of women leaders by creating opportunities to develop their leadership skills through transformative leadership capacity building and mentorship programs, facilitate solidarity and networking opportunities among women from all walks of lives and by collaborating with CSOs and electoral stakeholders to influence political party platforms and electoral processes.

To achieve its objectives, UN Women employees the below multi-pronged strategies:

Ongoing initiatives and partnerships

Awareness promotion, community mobilization, advocacy, and women’s agency: UN Women and CARE Ethiopia are collaborating in Amhara region to challenge negative social norms and stereotypes surrounding women's leadership using the Social Analysis and Action (SAA) method. To complement these efforts, UN Women is also working with Women Can Do It, a local women-led CSO, to provide capacity-building and advocacy training for media personnel across Ethiopia. By engaging with the media in this way, UN Women hopes to change outdated perceptions of women as incapable leaders and decision-makers. Additionally, UN Women is partnering with the Resource Center for Sustainable Change (RCSC) in Sidama Regional State to enhance women's role in peace building and conflict transformation efforts. In addition, given the significant role media plays to shape mindset towards women’s role as leaders and decision makers, UN Women in collaboration with Women Can Do It, a women lead local CSO, targeted media personnel all over Ethiopia including those working on advertisement for capacity building and advocacy. Collaborating effectively with the media can be a powerful tool for influencing public opinion and promoting gender equality, helping to transform outdated perceptions of women as incapable leaders and decision-makers.

Capacity building and mentorship for women leaders: UN Women collaborated with the Office of the President of Ethiopia under the Presidential Leadership Program for women leaders which is a flagship initiative of H.E President Sahle-work Zewde of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) that targeted 180 middle level women leaders in public, private and CSO sectors in six training cohorts. The leadership program is designed to create and expand a wider pool of transformative and influential women leaders and decision makers in Ethiopia. The Program was launched in the presence of H.E. the President on 1 February 2022 at the African Leadership Academy located in Sululta, Ethiopia. The program has equipped women leaders with new knowledge of leadership principles and enabled them to have an insight as to their own leadership styles by creating a platform for learning and networking with each other to address individual, systematic, and institutional barriers for effective and transformative leadership.

UN Women also collaborates with gender machineries at federal and regional level including Ministry of Women and Social Affairs, Regional Bureaus (Amhara and Oromia Bureau of Women, Children and Social Affairs (BoWCSA) to bring women at the center of the country’s development through promoting their participation in governance and public life at all levels. Particularly, UN Women works with Amhara and Oromia BoWCSA’s to create a sustainable backstop for women leaders by availing capacity building and mentorship opportunities for women leaders. Apart from expanding capacity building platforms, UN Women works with these regional gender machineries to expand multi-stakeholder networking platforms among women leaders and women rights advocates, academia CSOs and women from the private sector. In Amhara Region, UN Women supported the establishment of a Transformative Leadership for Gender Equality training Center in collaboration with Amhara BoWCSA and Bahirdar University. Since 2018, UN Women provided opportunities for 2,828 women leaders all over Ethiopia to develop their leadership skills through transformative leadership for gender equality trainings and mentorship and coaching programs. UN Women also collaborates CSOs and entities such as Network of Ethiopian Women Association (NEWA) and National Electoral Board of Ethiopia(NEBE) to engender the electoral cycle by targeting women political party members to enhance their campaigning and political leaders’ skills while partner with the House of Peoples Representatives(HoPR) to increase the influence women parliamentarism once they get to office by availing leadership capacity building opportunities.

Gender mainstreaming in policies and political institutions: The push to increase women's participation in political and leadership roles, both in elected offices and civil service management, must be accompanied by a gender-sensitive working environment. With this goal in mind, UN Women has partnered with institutions such as the House of Peoples Representatives (HoPR), the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE), and the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs (MoWSA) to conduct gender audits, gather data on women's leadership status, and chart a path towards meaningful institutional reforms that promote gender sensitivity.",women leaders

It can sustain efforts towards just, peaceful and inclusive societies; environmental and climate justice; equal participation in decision-making at all levels; universal access to essential public services; and economic prosperity for all. Yet, discriminatory legislation remains in all regions of the world, limiting the potential of billions of women and girls and often excluding them from the benefits of development.

In support of ‘Equality in Law for Women and Girls By 2030: A Multi-Stakeholder Strategy for Accelerated Action’ and Kenya’s commitment to gender equality, IDLO, UN Women and the Kenya Law Reform Commission have partnered to produce a legal assessment report.

This assessment, Strengthening Gender Equality in Law: Mapping Discriminatory Laws against Women and Girls in Kenya, provides an analysis of discriminatory laws against women and girls in Kenya and makes recommendations for the reform, repeal or passing of new laws with the goal of ensuring that the principle of equality and non-discrimination is reflected in law.

Despite Kenya having a robust Constitutional, legal and polciy framework, these frameworks have proved inadequate to fully realize the rights of women and girls. This is due to the inability to fully implement the existing provisions, reinforced by a patriarchal culture and gender stereotypes that discriminate against women and girls. This has hindered the substantive enjoyment of rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls on an equal basis with men and boys. The assessment found that a total of 9 laws or provisions must be repealed in whole or in part; 17 laws must be revised or amended, and new laws must be enacted in seven thematic areas to bring Kenya’s legislative framework in line with its regional and international obligations on GEWE.",equality law crucial achieving gender equality influencing multiple development outcomes sustain efforts towards peaceful inclusive societies environmental climate justice equal participation decisionmaking all levels universal access essential public services economic prosperity all yet discriminatory legislation remains all regions world limiting potential billions women girls often excluding benefits development support equality law women girls multistakeholder strategy accelerated action kenyas commitment gender equality idlo un women kenya law reform commission have partnered produce legal assessment report assessment strengthening gender equality law mapping discriminatory laws against women girls kenya provides analysis discriminatory laws against women girls kenya makes recommendations reform repeal passing new laws goal ensuring principle equality nondiscrimination reflected law despite kenya having robust constitutional legal polciy framework frameworks have proved inadequate fully realize rights women girls due inability fully implement existing provisions reinforced patriarchal culture gender stereotypes discriminate against women girls has hindered substantive enjoyment rights fundamental freedoms women girls equal basis men boys assessment found total laws provisions must repealed whole part laws must revised amended new laws must enacted seven thematic areas bring kenyas legislative framework line regional international obligations gewe

UN Women Kenya and UNESCO held a National Young Male Dialogue Forum on December 9 2024 to intensify efforts towards the intentional engagement of men as frontline champions in preventing femicide and violence against women and girls.

Male engagement is an approach to constructively involve men and boys for the benefit of both genders. The National Young Male Dialogue Forum examined the transformative impact that can be realized in engaging men as change agents to end femicide and pervasive violence against women and girls.

The Forum also delved into how gender norms shape the experience of men and boys as well as understanding the effect of stereotypes on men and boys, by promoting a deeper understanding of the social construction of masculinities in specific cultural and societal contexts

“Men can support gender equality by advocating for women's rights, endorsing gender-sensitive policies, and participating in gender equality-led campaigns to raise awareness on women’s empowerment. Many men are starting to challenge the pressure associated with traditional masculinity. They are using their voices and privilege to shift norms and perceptions about gender and working to address the patriarchal beliefs, practices, institutions and structures that have contributed to inequality between men and women. Men’s participation in helping to shape the future of gender roles and relations is crucial,” said Mr Sebastian Gatimu, UN Women Kenya Planning and Coordination Expert at the opening of the session.

Kenya has a target to end gender-based violence by 2026. Men must play a role in actualizing such goals. Additionally, the Kenya National Policy on Gender and Development of 2019 promotes male involvement in managing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). This is a huge step towards ensuring that men’s involvement is gender-sensitive in both the public and private spheres.

“Male counterparts are defenders of women and girls who are suffering in every community around the world. While women must continue to lead the movement for gender equality, we need to engage boys and young men more intentionally to achieve gender equality as well as prevent femicide and violence against women and girls,” Mr Gatimu added.

Rwanda South Africa Tanzania

The Generation Equality Forum (GEF) is an international initiative aimed at accelerating progress towards gender equality commitments, originally set during the 1995 Beijing Women’s Conference. Rwanda plays a leading role, especially in the Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation for Gender Equality, leveraging its expertise to reduce gender disparities in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), digital access, and innovation.

Rwanda’s Commitments and Priorities

Bridging the Gender Gap in Digital Access and Competencies:

Rwanda aims to achieve 100% mobile phone ownership among female-headed households by 2026, up from 54.4%. Efforts include initiatives such as Connect Rwanda 2.0 and fostering internet accessibility. Feminist Technology and Innovation:

The African Girls Can Code Initiative (AGCCI) and national programs target increasing women’s representation in STEM to 50% at the secondary level. Innovation ecosystems are being strengthened to increase women-led startups and digital financial services for women. Preventing Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (GBV):

Rwanda addresses online harassment and discrimination, emphasizing safe spaces for women in the digital economy. Inclusive Innovation Ecosystems:

Key ministries and partners work to promote gender inclusion in digital and financial sectors. This includes integrating gender-sensitive strategies in innovation policies and fostering private-sector collaboration.

Implementation Strategies

Biannual Reflection Roundtables:

Hosted by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF) and UN Women, these sessions bring together over 40 stakeholders from government, civil society, and the private sector. These forums evaluate progress, identify gaps, and refine action plans to ensure timely delivery of commitments by 2026.

Pre-existing gender-based discrimination and inequalities exacerbate the impact of crises on women and girls as inequality tends to worsen in humanitarian situations. Vulnerabilities such as disability, women-headed households, young women, adolescent girls, older women, and women belonging to indigenous and minority or marginalized groups, can deepen how people are affected and how they recover.

Women and girls are not helpless victims. Humanitarian efforts must recognize the fact that women and girls—like men and boys—have much to contribute in preparing for, and responding to, crises. Women must be included in decision-making about the forms of assistance and protection they need. Humanitarian action can also present opportunities for new and more progressive gender roles and relationships to emerge.

In East and Southern Africa incidences of drought, food insecurity, floods/cyclones, increasing fragility, and desert locusts have affected millions of people, particularly those in marginal areas, displaced into IDPs and refugee camps. Current estimates by humanitarian stakeholders (April 2022) indicate that a total of 33 million people are classified as food insecure (Phase 2), while over 21 million are in crisis mode and in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation is being worsened by skyrocketing food prices due to global shocks including the war in Ukraine. This region is home to over 5 million refugees and asylum seekers and 14 million internally displaced people. COVID- 19 continues to affect millions of people across the region, especially those that lost their sources of income and livelihoods.

Engendering DRR and Humanitarian Planning, Response, and Recovery Frameworks

We are engendering disaster risk reduction (DRR) and humanitarian planning, response, and recovery frameworks at regional and national levels. This includes integrating gender into humanitarian needs overviews, response plans (Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan), disaster risk management policies and strategies (Kenya), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development regional resilience framework, and others.

We carry out capacity development of stakeholders on Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) targeting UN Women staff, UN entities, humanitarian country teams, international non-governmental organizations, women’s organizations, and government representatives.

There is advocacy and production of knowledge products and tools such as the GiHA pocket guide, a training manual on women’s participation and leadership in humanitarian action, and a Gender Mainstreaming Guideline for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Regional level advocacy includes forums such as the African Union Africa Regional Platform for DRR that brings together policymakers and practitioners in DRR and where commitments are made by Member States Ministers.

Women's Leadership, Empowerment, Access and Protection (LEAP)

Disasters affect women more owing to a multiplicity of factors including access to resources (land, credit, technology) as well as loss of livelihoods. COVID-19 threatens to erode gains made on empowerment of women.

Women’s representation in public office remains low and so does their participation in elections as candidates. There are nine female and 64 males in the House of representatives, two females and 27 males in the House of Senate of the Bicameral national legislature. There are five female and 14 male ministers in the cabinet and this under representation cuts across local government. There is no obligatory gender provision yet in the elections law nor temporary special measure in the constitution. The provision in the electoral law on Section 4.5.1c states that, “A list of candidates submitted to the Commission for an election should endeavor to have no less than 30% of the candidates on the list from each gender.” An obligatory and enforceable provision without the clause ‘should endeavor’ rather ‘shall have’ is before the Senate after passing in the House of representative as part of the electoral law reform bill. The electoral system of First Past The Post (FPTP) (an electoral system in which votes are translated into seats) makes it even more difficult for the few women who get on party ballots to stand a chance of winning and there has been heightened incidences of violence against women in elections which further shrinks the space for women’s political participation. It is in this context that the work of the women political participation and leadership pillar in Liberia is focused.

Based on the achievements of women in politics and lessons learned to date, the Global Flagship Program Initiative (FPI) Theory of Change (ToC) envisions a four-pronged strategy under Goal 1 of the Entity’s Strategic Plan 2020-2024 “Women lead and participate in all areas of decision-making: (1) support development and implementation of robust legal frameworks and administrative arrangements that promote gender balance and facilitate women’s participation; (2) expand the pool of qualified and capable women to run for election; (3) transform gender norms so that women are accepted as legitimate and effective leaders; and (4) support women leaders in gender-sensitive political institutions to attract, promote and retain women leaders, and highlight the constructive contribution they make to decision-making.

Under this four-pronged approach, prong one supported the electoral bill reform agenda and its passage. A strong lobby and advocacy partnership with the women’s legislative caucus of Liberia (WLCL); Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP); civil society organisations (CSOs) and the National Elections Commission (NEC) and Communications company- Vivacious Consultants resulted in the passage of the Electoral Reform Bill inclusive of the obligatory 30% gender quota by the House of Representatives in February 2022. A spotlight was placed on a Protocol and action plan for violence against women in elections and politics (VAWiE-P) prevention and response working with NEC, which resulted in political parties signing to endorse the guideline as a working document ahead of the Lofa by-election in May 2022 and 2023 general elections.

On prong two, the pillar has 225 mentees from the 15 counties of Liberia trained under the young women political leadership mentoring program. This program bridges the gap between women leadership and young girls taking cognisance of the intergenerational discourse and co-creation of a diverse cadre of women political demagogues. The program established a national young women political council which considers sustainability of the program. Support also resulted in the establishment of a leadership clinic and website for training and support of female candidates. The pillar also supported the compilation of a data base of women with competencies in the various sectors of the economy with the MoGCSP to support gender balance in government.

Prong three focused on support to visibility of the work of the women leaders in the legislature and social norms change working with the Women’s legislative Caucus of Liberia, media and communications on women’s political rights. The media communications included, billboards, radio skits, jingles on women’s rights to participate in politics and facts on women’s representation in public life.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/11/cedaw-general-recommendation-no-40,CEDAW General Recommendation No. 40,"General Recommendation No. 40 is a visionary ‘parity’ roadmap for achieving equal and inclusive representation of women in decision-making systems across various sectors. It highlights the structural barriers, patriarchal norms and violence, and gender stereotypes that limit women's involvement in these systems. The Recommendation emphasizes the need for systemic action to achieve gender equality, particularly in facing modern challenges like climate change and ongoing conflicts.

GR 40 recommends specific legislative, policy, and other measures States should take to achieve parity in decision-making at levels. Its pillars of action, including 50:50 parity, youth engagement, intersectional inclusion, and structural transformation, are areas critically aligned with UN Women’s work.

UN Women, together with our partner OHCHR, have supported the elaboration and drafting process by providing the space for over 200 experts, academics, civil society representatives, and UN family members to provide their input on the document during five regional consultation meetings in Istanbul, Cairo, Addis Ababa, Bogota and Bangkok during 2024. These discussions were important for ensuring the draft reflects existing challenges and solutions to advancing women’s participation in decision-making from all regions. We would like to thank Regional Office for their support with these consultations.

As we approach the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, this General Recommendation is more relevant than ever. The goal of parity in decision-making at all levels is one of six key priority areas proposed in UN Women’s Beijing+30 Action Agenda, and the Recommendation provides a powerful roadmap to fast-track our collective action to achieve in national and local governments.",general recommendation visionary parity roadmap achieving equal inclusive representation women decisionmaking systems across various sectors highlights structural barriers patriarchal norms violence gender stereotypes limit womens involvement systems recommendation emphasizes need systemic action achieve gender equality particularly facing modern challenges like climate change ongoing conflicts gr recommends specific legislative policy other measures states take achieve parity decisionmaking levels pillars action including parity youth engagement intersectional inclusion structural transformation areas critically aligned un womens work un women together partner ohchr have supported elaboration drafting process providing space experts academics civil society representatives un family members provide input document during five regional consultation meetings istanbul cairo addis ababa bogota bangkok during discussions important ensuring draft reflects existing challenges solutions advancing womens participation decisionmaking all regions would like thank regional office support consultations approach th anniversary beijing declaration platform action general recommendation relevant ever goal parity decisionmaking all levels one six key priority areas proposed un womens beijing action agenda recommendation provides powerful roadmap fasttrack collective action achieve national local governments
https://africa.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/faqs/types-of-violence-1,Frequently asked questions: Types of violence against women and girls,"Violence against women and girls is one of the world’s most prevalent human rights violations, taking place every day, many times over, in every corner of the globe. It has serious short- and long-term physical, economic and psychological consequences on women and girls, preventing their full and equal participation in society. The magnitude of its impact, both in the lives of individuals and families and society as a whole, is immeasurable. Conditions created by the pandemic – including lockdowns, reduced mobility, heightened isolation, stress and economic uncertainty – have led to an alarming spike in domestic violence and have further exposed women and girls to other forms of violence, from child marriage to sexual harassment online. This FAQ provides an overview of the many forms of violence, along with other commonly used terms, that any gender equality activist should have in their vocabulary toolkit.

Key terms

Gender-based violence

Gender-based violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at an individual or a group of individuals based on their gender. It is rooted in gender inequality, the abuse of power and harmful norms. The term is primarily used to underscore the fact that structural, gender-based power differentials place women and girls at risk for multiple forms of violence. While women and girls suffer disproportionately from GBV, men and boys can also be targeted. The term is also sometimes used to describe targeted violence against LGBTQI+ populations, when referencing violence related to norms of masculinity/femininity and/or gender norms.

Violence against women and girls

Violence against women and girls is defined as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women and girls encompasses, but is not limited to, physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family or within the general community, and perpetrated or condoned by the State.

Survivor of violence

The term survivor of violence refers to any person who has experienced sexual or gender-based violence. It is similar in meaning to “victim”, but is generally preferred because it implies resilience.

Consent

No means No. Yes means Yes. Consent is an agreement between participants to engage in sexual activity or enter into marriage. It must be freely and actively given and cannot be provided by someone who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or by someone underage. Consent is specific, meaning that consent to one act does not imply consent to any others, and reversible, meaning that it may be revoked at any time.

Types of violence against women

Domestic violence

Domestic violence, also called domestic abuse or intimate partner violence, is any pattern of behavior that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner. It encompasses all physical, sexual, emotional, economic and psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. This is one of the most common forms of violence experienced by women globally.

Domestic violence can include the following.

Economic violence Economic violence involves making or attempting to make a person financially dependent by maintaining total control over financial resources, withholding access to money, and/or forbidding attendance at school or employment. Psychological violence Psychological violence involves causing fear by intimidation; threatening physical harm to self, partner or children; destruction of pets and property; “mind games”; or forcing isolation from friends, family, school and/or work. Emotional violence Emotional violence includes undermining a person's sense of self-worth through constant criticism; belittling one's abilities; name-calling or other verbal abuse; damaging a partner's relationship with the children; or not letting a partner see friends and family. Physical violence Physical violence involves hurting or trying to hurt a partner by hitting, kicking, burning, grabbing, pinching, shoving, slapping, hair-pulling, biting, denying medical care or forcing alcohol and/or drug use, or using other physical force. It may include property damage. Sexual violence Sexual violence involves forcing a partner to take part in a sex act when the partner does not consent. See more about sexual violence below.

Femicide

Femicide refers to the intentional murder of women because they are women, but may be defined more broadly to include any killings of women or girls. Femicide differs from male homicide in specific ways. For example, most cases of femicide are committed by partners or ex-partners, and involve ongoing abuse in the home, threats or intimidation, sexual violence or situations where women have less power or fewer resources than their partner.

Honor killing Honor killing is the murder of a family member, usually a woman or girl, for the purported reason that the person has brought dishonor or shame upon the family. These killings often have to do with sexual purity, and supposed transgressions on the part of female family members.

Sexual violence

Sexual violence is any sexual act committed against the will of another person, either when this person does not give consent or when consent cannot be given because the person is a child, has a mental disability, or is severely intoxicated or unconscious as a result of alcohol or drugs.

Sexual violence can include the following.

Sexual harassment Sexual harassment encompasses non-consensual physical contact, like grabbing, pinching, slapping, or rubbing against another person in a sexual way. It also includes non-physical forms, such as catcalls, sexual comments about a person’s body or appearance, demands for sexual favors, sexually suggestive staring, stalking, and exposing one’s sex organs. Rape Rape is any non-consensual vaginal, anal or oral penetration of another person with any bodily part or object. This can be by any person known or unknown to the survivor, within marriage and relationships, and during armed conflict. Corrective rape Corrective rape is a form of rape of perpetrated against someone on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is intended to force the victim to conform to heterosexuality or normative gender identity. Rape culture Rape culture is the social environment that allows sexual violence to be normalized and justified. It is rooted in patriarchy and fueled by persistent gender inequalities and biases about gender and sexuality.

Human trafficking

Human trafficking is the acquisition and exploitation of people, through means such as force, fraud, coercion, or deception. This heinous crime ensnares millions of women and girls worldwide, many of whom are sexually exploited.

Female genital mutilation

Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is classified into four major types, and both the practice and the motivations behind it vary from place to place. FGM is a social norm, often considered a necessary step in preparing girls for adulthood and marriage and typically driven by beliefs about gender and its relation to appropriate sexual expression. It was first classified as violence in 1997 via a joint statement issued by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA.

Child marriage

Child marriage refers to any marriage where one or both of the spouses are below the age of 18. It is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.” Girls are more likely to be child brides, and consequently drop out of school and experience other forms of violence.

Online or digital violence

Online or digital violence against women refers to any act of violence that is committed, assisted or aggravated by the use of information and communication technology (mobile phones, the Internet, social media, computer games, text messaging, email, etc) against a woman because she is a woman.

Online violence can include the following.

Cyberbullying Cyberbullying involves the sending of intimidating or threatening messages. Non-consensual sexting Non-consensual sexting involves the sending of explicit messages or photos without the recipient’s consent. Doxing Doxing involves the public release of private or identifying information about the victim.

Impact Stories from Generation Equality Commitment Makers Working in the Action Coalition on Gender-Based Violence in ESAR: Lady of Peace Community Foundation (LOPECO)

Honoring Change-Makers: The 16 Actors on Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG) Awards to Empower Communities to Combat GBVF: The 16 Actors on Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG) Awards, spearheaded by the Lady of Peace Community Foundation (LOPECO) in partnership with UN Women and local organizations, have become a powerful catalyst in South Africa's fight against gender-based violence (GBV) and femicide (GBVF). Launched in response to the surge in GBVF, the initiative honors individuals and organizations working at the grassroots level to combat these issues.

The EVAWG Awards are a vital component of the UNiTE by 2030 Campaign, advocating for global action to end violence against women and girls. Since its inception, the initiative has recognized 32 community actors across four South African provinces: Gauteng, Western Cape, Northwest, and KwaZulu-Natal boosting awareness, activism, and concrete steps toward ending GBVF. More than 68% of awardees are women survivors of GBVF, whose initiatives have been empowered with R16,000 grants, enabling them to expand their work and gain broader visibility and networking opportunities.

Through capacity-building workshops, awardees have gained vital skills in advocacy, leadership, and mobilization, enhancing their ability to drive change within their communities. The awards have also encouraged greater male involvement in the conversation around gender equality and GBVF challenging traditional norms and making men allies in the fight against GBVF. Many awardees have organized dialogues and support groups for men and boys, encouraging their active participation in preventing GBVF. This focus on male engagement is proving transformative, with many communities seeing a shift in traditional gender norms. Notable outcomes from the awards include new campaigns, peace dialogues, educational workshops, and mental health support groups. These initiatives have helped to create safer spaces and address the root causes of violence in communities. Some awardees have gone on to lead community mediation workshops, promoting domestic peace and strengthening community ties.

LOPECO’s ongoing support, including partnerships with mental health professionals and continued awareness campaigns, ensures that awardees’ efforts remain sustainable and impactful. The program's success highlights the importance of collaboration between civil society, government, and local organizations to create a lasting movement for gender equality. The 16 Actors awards are also a critical part of building sustained, community-driven movements to end GBVF and promote gender equality. Bishop Michael Mtshali, a 2022 awardee, reflects:

This award has opened doors for me in my community, and I am now one of the most recognised people in Tembisa that help bring peace and change. With the award, I was able to help my community and help my family out - Bishop Michael Mtshali.

Looking ahead, the initiative’s potential to expand across Southern Africa and integrate into national GBVF prevention strategies promises to scale its impact, driving long-term change in the region. The awards are not just about awarding individuals but building a sustained, community-driven force for gender equality and the elimination of GBVF.",photo credit lady peace community foundation lopeco impact stories generation equality commitment makers working action coalition genderbased violence esar lady peace community foundation lopeco honoring changemakers actors ending violence against women girls evawg awards empower communities combat gbvf actors ending violence against women girls evawg awards spearheaded lady peace community foundation lopeco partnership un women local organizations have become powerful catalyst south africas fight against genderbased violence gbv femicide gbvf launched response surge gbvf initiative honors individuals organizations working grassroots level combat issues evawg awards vital component unite campaign advocating global action end violence against women girls since inception initiative has recognized community actors across four south african provinces gauteng western cape northwest kwazulunatal boosting awareness activism concrete steps toward ending gbvf awardees women survivors gbvf whose initiatives have empowered r grants enabling expand work gain broader visibility networking opportunities through capacitybuilding workshops awardees have gained vital skills advocacy leadership mobilization enhancing ability drive change within communities awards have also encouraged greater male involvement conversation around gender equality gbvf challenging traditional norms making men allies fight against gbvf many awardees have organized dialogues support groups men boys encouraging active participation preventing gbvf focus male engagement proving transformative many communities seeing shift traditional gender norms notable outcomes awards include new campaigns peace dialogues educational workshops mental health support groups initiatives have helped create safer spaces address root causes violence communities awardees have gone lead community mediation workshops promoting domestic peace strengthening community ties lopecos ongoing support including partnerships mental health professionals continued awareness campaigns ensures awardees efforts remain sustainable impactful programs success highlights importance collaboration between civil society government local organizations create lasting movement gender equality actors awards also critical part building sustained communitydriven movements end gbvf promote gender equality bishop michael mtshali awardee reflects award has opened doors community am one recognised people tembisa help bring peace change award able help community help family bishop michael mtshali looking ahead initiatives potential expand across southern africa integrate national gbvf prevention strategies promises scale impact driving longterm change region awards awarding individuals building sustained communitydriven force gender equality elimination gbvf

Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations. It is a major obstacle to the fulfilment of women’s and girls’ human rights and to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – which aims to leave no one behind. Ending violence against women and girls (EVAWG) is considered one of the most important and urgent priorities for UN Women in Liberia, where patriarchal social norms are deeply rooted and VAWG is widely accepted.

UN Women’s Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAW) pillar builds on previous and existing work on violence against women and girls including the first, second and third generations of the SGBV Joint Programmes based on five strategy pillars including Prevention, Response, Institutional strengthening and Advocacy, communication and Social Mobilisation and Coordination. These Pillars inform the Spotlight Initiative, which is a joint initiative of the United Nations System and the European Union in partnership with the Government and Civil Society of Liberia, which seek to contribute to the elimination of sexual and gender- based violence, harmful practices and obstacles to access to sexual and reproductive health rights. In Liberia, the Spotlight Initiative was launched in 2019.

UN Women Activities

UN Women is delivering on activities in three out of the six pillars, which include the following; Pillar 2 – Institutional Strengthening, Pillar 3 – Prevention and Social Norms and Pillar 6 – Civil society organisations (CSOs) and Women Movement. The program seeks to deliver on a) the institutionalization of Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting Principles (GRPB) in 6 government line ministries, b) build the capacity of CSOs and women rights groups to conduct evidence based monitoring, advocacy and awareness campaigns, c) engage traditional, religious, community leaders and members in addressing negative social norms attitudes and behavior and the elimination of the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), d) build the capacity of media practitioners and media institutions in gender sensitive and ethical reporting, e) build the capacity of CSOs and Women Rights Groups such that they are integrated in coalitions and networks and can better advocate for ending all forms of violence against women and girls and f) provide grants to CSOs and Women Rights groups to conduct awareness activities and support survivors of violence in hard to reach communities so as to provide them access to services including legal aid.

Traditional practitioners from Grand Cape Mount in western Liberia showcase how the economic alternative livelihood program under the Spotlight Initiative has transformed their life.

Some Achievements of Phase One

• With the institutionalization of Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting (GRPB) Principles in the draft final year 2022 National Budget, the Government of Liberia has allotted USD$380,000.00 in the draft FY 2022 National Budget to support the institutionalization of gender responsive budgeting in nine (9) line Ministries;

• 300 former traditional practitioners were involved in climate smart agriculture program, Village Savings Loans and businesses. To date, 12 Village and Savings Loan Association (VSLAs) grew their capital from LD$2,149,775.00 in 2020 to LD$5,173,820.00 in 2022. This has resulted in an increase in household incomes for traditional practitioners and sustain their businesses, most of which have grown from small businesses to middle-level businesses.

• 23,425 community dwellers from 212 communities (8,480 women, 5,382 men, 4,966 girls and 4,597 boys), including traditional, religious and community leaders, have increased knowledge on SGBV and COVID-19 preventive measures as well as information on the referral pathway

• 388 media practitioners (91 females and 197 males) from 66 media institutions including 44 radio stations, 13 newspapers, 3 television stations and 6 online/social media outlets were trained to have increased knowledge and skills in advocacy, media engagement and Gender Sensitive Reporting of SGBV cases and ensuring that survivors/victims are not re-victimized or stigmatized.

• The development of the Comprehensive Prevention Strategy Document, the first of its kind in Africa which took into consideration potential and actual perpetrators and laid the road map to address the underlying root causes, gender inequality discriminatory norms and values, based on a thorough analysis of risk factors for the forms of violence that it seeks to address including promoting change in social norms, attitudes and behaviors at all levels;

• Establishment of 5 CSO Secretariats that coordinates the activities of CSOs including those representing vulnerable and marginalized groups that addresses SGBV, HPs and promotion of SRHRs;

Information on Phase 2

The program seeks to build on lessons learned during the implementation of Phase 1 activities, which include extension of the alternative economic livelihood opportunities for traditional practitioners in 6 non-spotlight counties in Liberia, monitoring of the enforcement of the policy statement on the suspension of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) throughout Liberia, strengthening engagement with male network and groups as well as marginalized and vulnerable groups and strengthening the capacities of media practitioners and institutions as well as civil society organisation in advocating for the rights of women and girls

28 July - UN Women Mozambique, in close collaboration with the District Services for Health, Women and Social Action (SDSMAS), and Civil Society Organizations AREPACHO and FONGA, conducted a skills-building session for community, traditional and religious leaders in the district of Chongoene, Gaza Province, Mozambique.

Gender inequality contributes to the spread of HIV, increasing disproportionately infection rates, and reducing the ability of women and adolescent girls to cope with the epidemic at the community level. Adolescent girls and young women face barriers to the negotiation of safer sex because of unequal power dynamics with men.

The overall objective of the session was to renew the commitment of local leaders and enhance their knowledge to ensure community engagement and response to negative gender norms and harmful practices to remove gender-related barriers to accessing HIV services.

Mozambique is among the 10 highest affected countries in the world. The gendered trends of the epidemic are concerning as evidenced. According to 2020 UNAIDS estimates, in every hour 3 adolescent girls and young women, aged 15 to 24 years old, are infected by HIV, whereas 1 adolescent boy or young man is infected. every 20 minutes, an adolescent girl, and young woman is infected by HIV in Mozambique. 2.1 million people live with HIV, of which 63% are women and adolescent girls. Adolescent girls and young women in the age group of 15 to 24 years old represent 30% of all new HIV infections in the country, despite forming only 10% of the country’s total population. The Province of Gaza registers the highest HIV prevalence, at 24.1% against the 11.5% national prevalence. (UNAIDS Spectrum Estimates, 2021)

The training session took place at a crucial time, in the context of the national campaign ""Somos Iguais"" (We Are All Equal), launched by the Mozambican Government to fight discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS, and increase the uptake of testing and treatment, particularly among men.

Sessions in the training fostered participant discussions concerning prevailing negative socio-cultural norms that are hindering progress towards full access of HIV services by women and adolescent girls. They also strengthened participants’ knowledge on gender dynamics in sexual relations, positive models of masculinity, and the importance of guaranteeing HIV services for young women and adolescent girls.

As a result of the 3-day sessions, fifty local leaders, including 16 women, are better equipped to exercise gender-transformative leadership in their function as role models and key change agents in the governance of HIV and AIDS response systems.

The feedback from participants was positive and they have reiterated their commitment to tackle gender-based barriers to accessing health services in Chongoene.

Alda Ernesto Vilanculos, a Community Leader in Madoene Neighbourhood, reflects on the root causes of the increased vulnerability to HIV infection and limited access to services by young women and adolescent girls in Chongoene. Among them, she highlights intergenerational sex, as well as the economic dimension informing the choice and decision-making on sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR).

""We are living in a country under absolute poverty. Even though we have health services, available information and free contraceptives, people still lack some of the most basic economic opportunities. Young girls who are economically disadvantaged and especially vulnerable engage in risky sex in order to gain access to material benefits.""

Francisco Eugénio Mambo, a Community Leader in Machingane Neighbourhood, Chongoene points to migrant labour to the neighbouring South Africa as a key factor to be considered in the prevention of new infections.

""Unprotected sex is one of the key reasons why we have such high infection rates here in Gaza. Some young men who are working in neighboring South Africa engage in unprotected sex and contract the virus as a result. When they return, they engage in unprotected sex with their partners and end up infecting them as well, making our community even more vulnerable.""

Dorca Francisco Langa, Social Activist and Coordinator at AREPACHO, assesses the impact of scattered population distribution, and the role of women’s movement in bringing forward transformative change in the accessibility of HIV services to the further left behind women and adolescent girls in rural areas, in alignment with the Global AIDS Strategy principle of Community-Centred Services (2021-2026).

""As Civil Society, we come in to support the existing health services, which are not always accessible to every person. We go door to door to mobilize and encourage people to test and adhere to the treatment. There are still a lot of stigmas, and many people end up abandoning the treatment. Making time to talk, explain and clarify people's concerns has been essential.""

Tomás Felisberto Massingue, a Religious Leader and Pastor at the Zionist Pentecostal Church of Mozambique in Chongoene, shows concern with the high rate of new infections and reaffirms the instrumental role of religious leaders in closing the gaps that are preventing progress towards ending AIDS in Gaza. For that, he works closely with the health facilities in Chongoene, building synergies between health professionals and faith leaders as they contribute to the development of the same community. He is against any attempt by religious sects to prevent their members from accessing HIV treatment.

""The role of the church is to heal the soul. We work closely with the health services because we understand that their role is to heal the body. For this reason, I call on all religious leaders, to mobilize our congregations, and to ask the community to go to the health posts and take advantage of the HIV treatments.""

Laura Albino Cossa, Pastor at the Igreja de Narazé (Church of Nazarene) in Chongoene, echoes the aforementioned sentiments on the impact of faith in promoting or preventing access to HIV services by community members. For her, the awareness on the complementarity between the spiritual life and beliefs, and the conventional health treatments is an essential factor that explains the frequent abandonment of HIV treatment.

She observes that most of the church goers, among them women and adolescent girls as the majority, understand that their HIV status and diagnosis requires immediate attention and support, and see existing health services as the appropriate place to secure it.

""It is common for men in our community to associate HIV with witchcraft. For this and other reasons, it's difficult to mobilize them to seek services at the hospital. Since women are more active church goers and believers, they tend to visit the hospital right away, which explains why women in our community adhere more to HIV treatment.""",training community

“The greatest challenge faced by women and children survivors of violence here in Pemba is what we call ‘Muhali’—an unspoken code of silence,” says Asia Abrahmani Ali, a 53-year-old mother of seven living in the lush green hills of Pemba, part of Tanzania's Zanzibar Archipelago off the East African coast. Known for its vibrant clove plantations and rolling hills, Pemba’s culture is deeply rooted in traditions like Muhali.

In Zanzibar, ‘Muhali’ represents a cultural norm where people hesitate to take action against someone they know well.

“When incidents of gender-based violence occur, they therefore often go unreported simply because the perpetrator is a family member, neighbour, or friend of the family,” Asia explains.

Asia is one of 36 Women and Children Coordinators—community volunteers working with the Ministry of Gender in Pemba with support from UN Women, to strengthen coordinated efforts to promote women’s rights and address violence against women and children.

Moved by the persistent and often unreported incidents of violence in her community, she became a volunteer in 2023, determined to make a tangible difference in the lives of women.

In Tanzania, despite significant strides achieved through robust legal frameworks and policies, one in three women and girls continue to face physical, sexual, or other forms of abuse. Harmful practices persist, with over two million girls subjected to female genital mutilation and 23% married before the age of 18. In Pemba, nearly half of the more than 280,000 women residents are estimated to have experienced some form of violence. Yet, reporting remains low— according to data from the Zanzibar Office of the Chief Government Statistician, only 252 incidents of violence against women and girls were reported to the police in 2023.

Through support from the European Union Delegation to Tanzania, UN Women is implementing a five-year project titled ‘Ending Violence Against Women & Girls and Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Public Sector in Zanzibar & Tanzania Mainland’. The project focuses on creating an enabling environment and more equitable services for women to live free from violence. It also seeks to enhance equality in participation, leadership, and decision-making, including in enhancing women’s access to justice.

Through this project, 36 Shehias (local administrative areas) have selected Women and Children Coordinators to raise awareness by conducting educational and sensitization sessions across local communities, aiming to shift perceptions and social norms around violence against women and children and promote safer public spaces. The project equipped the Coordinators with the knowledge and skills necessary to identify, prevent and respond to cases of violence against women and children.

With deep roots in the community, the Coordinators have a unique understanding of the challenges women and children face when coming forward to report abuse and serve as vital links to law enforcement agencies and other essential services.

""As the Coordinator for my Shehia in Mtangani, I engage community members in discussions about their rights, the impacts of gender-based violence, and how to report incidents,” says Asia. She also makes a concerted effort to engage men, helping them understand the critical role they play in preventing gender-based violence.

According to Asya Abdallah Said, the Community Development Officer at the District Office of the Ministry of Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children, who coordinates the network of Women and Children Coordinators, the project is significantly increasing community awareness in Pemba.

""Many people didn’t fully understand the concept of violence or gender-based violence, often thinking it had to be physical or lethal to qualify. This project has shed light on the various forms of violence that women experience—forms that were previously accepted as part of life or tradition.""

Looking ahead, Asya Abdallah Said says the government aims to expand educational outreach to ensure knowledge and awareness reach even the most remote communities.

""We have been equipped with the knowledge we need,” says Samira Abrahmani Khadil, a Coordinator from the Ukutini Shehia. “Now, my main focus now is on reaching young people as they are essential for driving positive developmental change. I’ve started in my community, where I hold talks in schools and other areas on violence prevention, the importance of respecting the law, and the crucial role of gender equality in building a healthy society.""

As for Asya, she remains dedicated to her role as a volunteer coordinator and plans to continue her work for many years to come. ""I find the work very fulfilling and am happy to make a difference in my community. When women are finally free from violence, I’ll know that I was part of that change. That’s all I can ask for.""",asia abrahmani ali women children coordinator mtangani shehia pemba photo un women greatest challenge faced women children survivors violence here pemba what call muhalian unspoken code silence says asia abrahmani ali yearold mother seven living lush green hills pemba part tanzanias zanzibar archipelago off east african coast known vibrant clove plantations rolling hills pembas culture deeply rooted traditions like muhali zanzibar muhali represents cultural norm where people hesitate take action against someone know well when incidents genderbased violence occur therefore often go unreported simply because perpetrator family member neighbour friend family asia explains asia one women children coordinatorscommunity volunteers working ministry gender pemba support un women strengthen coordinated efforts promote womens rights address violence against women children moved persistent often unreported incidents violence her community became volunteer determined make tangible difference lives women tanzania despite significant strides achieved through robust legal frameworks policies one three women girls continue face physical sexual other forms abuse harmful practices persist two million girls subjected female genital mutilation married age pemba nearly half women residents estimated have experienced form violence yet reporting remains low according data zanzibar office chief government statistician incidents violence against women girls reported police through support european union delegation tanzania un women implementing fiveyear project titled ending violence against women girls advancing womens leadership public sector zanzibar tanzania mainland project focuses creating enabling environment equitable services women live free violence also seeks enhance equality participation leadership decisionmaking including enhancing womens access justice through project shehias local administrative areas have selected women children coordinators raise awareness conducting educational sensitization sessions across local communities aiming shift perceptions social norms around violence against women children promote safer public spaces project equipped coordinators knowledge skills necessary identify prevent respond cases violence against women children deep roots community coordinators have unique understanding challenges women children face when coming forward report abuse serve vital links law enforcement agencies other essential services un women facilitated training women coordinators pemba photo un women coordinator shehia mtangani engage community members discussions rights impacts genderbased violence how report incidents says asia also makes concerted effort engage men helping understand critical role play preventing genderbased violence according asya abdallah said community development officer district office ministry community development gender elders children who coordinates network women children coordinators project significantly increasing community awareness pemba many people didnt fully understand concept violence genderbased violence often thinking had physical lethal qualify project has shed light various forms violence women experienceforms previously accepted part life tradition asya abdallah said community development officer district office ministry community development gender elders children photo un women looking ahead asya abdallah said says government aims expand educational outreach ensure knowledge awareness reach even remote communities have equipped knowledge need says samira abrahmani khadil coordinator ukutini shehia main focus reaching young people essential driving positive developmental change ive started community where hold talks schools other areas violence prevention importance respecting law crucial role gender equality building healthy society asya remains dedicated her role volunteer coordinator plans continue her work many years come find work very fulfilling am happy make difference community when women finally free violence ill know part change thats all ask

Dakar, 25 November 2022

UN Secretary-General annual 16 Days of Activism against Violence towards Women and Girls campaign kicks off each year on 25 November, which is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until 10 December, Human Rights Day. During the campaign, which distinctive color is orange, a multitude of events are organized around the world to accelerate efforts to end violence against women and girls. As the other regions of the world, West and Central Africa will be actively involved. Under this year's theme "" UNITE, Activism to end violence against women and girls"", a call is made to governments, partners, and all citizens to show solidarity with women's rights movements and activists. On this occasion, everyone is invited to join the global momentum to end violence against women and girls once and for ever. The campaign aims to condemn the increase in anti-feminist hate speech, the shrinking of civil society space, the many threats to women's rights defenders and, in general, the backlash against the space for women's rights organizations to lead change.

Ms. Florence Raes, Regional Director a.i for UN Women West and Central Africa states in this context that: ""UN Women's ambition is to raise awareness in the sub-region on its different issues, namely the fight against GBV during the 16 days of activism, to increase synergies, regional cooperation while providing efforts to achieve the creation of shared agendas with stakeholders working on the elimination of GBV which is a priority for UN Women and its partners”.

To this end, the UN Women Regional Office for West and Central Africa is organizing and supporting several activities in the region:

The Forum of Women's Movements for the Elimination of GBV in West and Central Africa in Abidjan, from 7 to 8 December 2022. The meeting aims to strengthen the common regional agenda of women's movements in the West and Central Africa region and to celebrate women's movements and women activists through the organization of an exhibition dedicated to them.

The Forum with traditional leaders as actors of change to end violence against women in Douala, Cameroon from 15 to 16 December 2022, in partnership with MUSKOKA Funds. This forum aims to contribute to changing social norms for the elimination of early marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Central and West Africa and to contribute to improving the reproductive health of mothers, newborns, children, and teenagers.

Despite satisfactory progress, West and Central Africa still struggling with harmful practices for women and girls

Despite the significant actions of governments, women's movements and activists, violence is still a reality in the region and must be addressed.

More than one out of three women (36.6%) in Africa reports having experienced physical and/or sexual violence from a partner or sexual violence from a non-partner.

Child marriage is particularly problematic in West and Central Africa, which has 6 of the 10 countries with the highest levels of child marriage prevalence in the world.

At least 200 million women and girls, between 15 and 49 years old, have undergone female genital mutilation in 31 countries where the practice is highly practiced. In sub-Saharan Africa, 1 out of 4 women or girls have undergone FGM.

Breast ironing, an archaic practice, is still widespread in Cameroon, where 1 out of 4 girls is said to be affected. This ancestral cultural phenomenon is also present in other Central and West African countries, such as Chad, Togo, Benin and Guinea.

In view of these worrying figures, there is a need to focus on basic prevention by addressing the deep-seated causes of such violence

To mark the 16 Days of Activism, a new study released by UNODC and UN Women shows that in 2021, on average, more than five women or girls were killed by someone in their own circle every hour. The report, released on the eve of the International Day to End Violence against Women - commemorated on 25 November - is a stark reminder that violence against women and girls is one of the most common human rights abuses in the world.

Of all the women and girls killed intentionally last year, about 56 percent were killed by an intimate partner or another family member (45,000 out of 81,000), showing that the home is not even a safe place for many of them. In comparison, only 11 percent of homicides against men occur in the private sphere.

Ms. Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women reports: ""Every femicide statistic is just a story of a woman or girl that life has not favored. But these losses can be prevented - and the tools and knowledge to do so already exist. Women's rights organizations are already analyzing the data and advocating for policy change and greater accountability. What we need now is concerted action involving all of society that will enable women and girls to feel safe, in their homes, on the streets, and wherever they are, and to truly be safe.""

But disparities also exist at regional levels: while femicide is a problem in every country in the world, the report shows that in absolute numbers, Asia recorded the highest number of sex-related murders in the private sphere in 2021, and that the chances of women and girls being killed by their intimate partner, or any other family member were highest in Africa. In the same year, the rate of gender-based private crime was estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 women in Africa, compared to 1.4 in America, 1.2 in Oceania, 0.8 in Asia and 0.6 in Europe. At the same time, the evidence suggests that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 coincided with a notable increase in gender-based private crime in North America and, to some extent, in Western and Southern Europe as well.

However, gender-based crimes, as well as other forms of violence against women and girls, are not inevitable. They can and must be prevented, and this requires a combination of measures: identifying women victims of violence at the earliest possible stage; providing them with access to adequate support and protection; and ensuring that law enforcement and justice systems are more responsive to their needs. Efforts should also be directed at basic prevention by addressing the fundamental causes of such violence, including changing harmful forms of masculinity and social norms, addressing structural gender inequalities, and ending gender stereotypes. It is also critical to compile more data on femicide to inform the development of policies and programs to prevent and end violence against women and girls.

https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/news/2025/03/empowering-rwandas-parliamentarians-training-on-gender-equality-for-stronger-leadership,Empowering Rwanda’s Parliamentarians: Training on Gender Equality for Stronger Leadership,"Rwanda continues to make remarkable strides in advancing gender equality and women's leadership. With a group of newly inducted parliamentarians, coinciding with the adoption of the Government’s second National Strategy for Transformation (NST2), the ‘30+ years of the Beijing Platform for Action’ country report, and national and global gender frameworks, it was crucial for Rwanda’s 80 parliamentarians (51 women and 29 men) to enhance their understanding of gender-responsive and transformative governance, leadership, and development.

To address this need, UN Women, in collaboration with the Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum (FFRP), organized a two-day induction training on gender equality and women’s transformational leadership at the Parliament of Rwanda. The training aimed to equip parliamentarians with essential knowledge and skills to integrate gender equality into parliamentary work and processes. and provide insights into national and global gender equality commitments including CEDAW, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Maputo Protocol, and the National Gender Policy. The training also emphasized the importance of gender responsive planning and budgeting to enhance accountability for gender equality and women’s empowerment.

Rwanda has increased women's representation in the Chamber of Deputies from 61.3% in 2018 to 63.75% in 2024, complemented by women holding 35.48% of cabinet positions. These figures underscore the Government of Rwanda’s commitment to not only sustaining its gender equality achievements, but further advancing them as a global benchmark.

In her welcoming remarks, the chairperson of the Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum (FFRP), Ms. Uwizeyimana Marie Therese, expressed her appreciation of the partnership between the Parliament of Rwanda and UN Women, highlighting that the training would ensure gender equality and women’s empowerment remains a central priority across all leadership sectors.

Ms. Uwizeyimana reaffirmed the forum’s commitment to advancing Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE), aligned with the NST2 and Vision 2050. She acknowledged the unwavering dedication of the Government of Rwanda, under the leadership of H.E. Paul Kagame, in championing GEWE. “His Excellency’s steadfast commitment has been instrumental in accelerating progress toward closing gender gaps, fostering sustainable development, and ensuring a more inclusive and equitable future for all Rwandans,” she added.

Addressing the parliamentarians, Ms. Tikikel Tadele Alemu, UN Women Programme Management Specialist speaking on behalf of the UN Women Country Representative, Ms. Jennet Kem, commended Rwanda’s leadership, acknowledging the progress made in transforming the lives of women and girls. She urged parliamentarians to remain steadfast in tackling persistent challenges.

“I would thus like to call upon our honorable parliamentarians to remain steadfast in challenging negative social attitudes and pushbacks that continue to undermine the progress we have made on GEWE. Your continued leadership is essential in safeguarding the gains achieved and ensuring a future of equality and empowerment for all.” stated Ms. Alemu.

Several key priorities for future action emerged from the discussions, including consistent public awareness and education on gender equality to dismantle discriminatory gender stereotypes and cultural norms, strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders on gender analysis to prevent misleading perceptions of gender as solely a women’s issue, enhancing women’s financial capacity through economic empowerment initiatives, strengthening women’s leadership in local governance, and strengthening institutional capacities to effectively interpret and utilize gender statistics.

Delivering remarks, the Rt.Hon. Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Kazarwa Gertrude emphasized the importance of collective action among parliamentarians in embedding GEWE within all policy frameworks and interventions.

“We all know that we still have some pitfalls and setbacks hindering gender equality. However, we can overcome these challenges and make significant progress with our collective efforts. Therefore, we have to put more effort into assessing the government program, the expected results, and the remaining challenges, ensuring that the current budget and programs are meeting the key objective of ensuring gender equality and women empowerment are both embedded in our policies.” emphasized Kazarwa Gertrude.

Closing the training, the Rt. Hon. President of the Senate, Kalinda François-Xavier underscored the Parliament's unwavering commitment to championing gender equality and women's empowerment. He assured all attendees that the outcomes identified during the training would be considered with urgency.
