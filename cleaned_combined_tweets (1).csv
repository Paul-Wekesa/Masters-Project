Dada commended the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu for his numerous support on the initiative, emphasising the importance of empowering these set of parents as a vital step towards achieving sustainable development while reducing poverty and providing means of livelihood to get them back on their feet.¬†  She said, ‚ÄúAs we empower women with skills and resources, we are not only lifting individuals out of poverty but also transforming families"".  Also speaking at the event, the Chairman of SUBEB, Dr. Hakeem Babatunde Shittu also lauded the state Governor's efforts in making sure no child is left behind because every child deserves to be educated.¬†  Highlights of the Life Skill Economic Empowerment Programme included workshops, health talks by staff of Lagos State Health Insurance Agency (LASHMA), practical training in various fields such as entrepreneurship, financial literacy, vocational skills in catering and confectionaries, make up, gele tying, hair and wig making, soap, pomade, insecticide, throw pillows and duvet, ankara crafts and leather works, events planning and decoration, tie & dye, fabric stoning and embellishment.  The event also featured presentation of certificates to all the participants and kits to enable them kick start their business.  The participants expressed gratitude to the Lagos State government for the opportunity to learn and grow, with many expressing how the skills acquired have instilled a new found confidence in their abilities to contribute economically to their households and communities.  Also present at the event was the Permanent board member in charge of social mobilisation for out-of-school children, Amudalat Idowu Tiamiyu and Director of Women Department, WAPA, Mrs. Funke Shyllon.
